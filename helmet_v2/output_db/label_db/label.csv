12049324,Konta T,The health-economic impact of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing for chronic kidney disease in Japanese non-diabetic patients,Clin Exp Nephrol,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: The objective of this analysis was to estimate the clinical and economic impact of undertaking urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) testing alongside regular estimated glomerular filtration rate testing for chronic kidney disease in non-diabetic Japanese patients versus no testing and versus urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) testing. METHODS: An economic model, taking a Japanese healthcare perspective, estimated the health-economic impact of UACR testing over a lifetime time horizon. Outcomes reported were additional costs, clinical benefits measured, such as prevented dialyses and cardiovascular events, quality-adjusted life years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Health states were derived from risk levels reported in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes heatmap. Results were derived assuming that after testing, treatment was available in the form of current standard-of-care or emerging chronic kidney disease therapies. RESULTS: Repeated UACR testing was found to be cost-effective compared to both no urine testing and UPCR testing, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ¥1,953,958 and ¥1,966,433, respectively.

10137341,Lim VW,Budget Impact Analysis of Adopting a One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) Alone Diagnostic Pathway for Clostridioides difficile in Japan Compared to a Two-Step Algorithm with Glutamate Dehydrogenase/Toxin Followed by NAAT,Diagnostics (Basel),2023.0,"- Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major healthcare-associated infection that leads to a significant health economic burden in Japan. Using a decision tree model, we evaluated the budget impact of adopting a one-step nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) alone pathway compared to a two-step diagnostic algorithm with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxin antigen, followed by NAAT. The analysis was conducted from the government payer's perspective for 100,000 symptomatic, hospitalized adults requiring a CDI diagnostic test. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted for all data inputs. The NAAT alone strategy costed JPY 225,886,360 (USD 2,424,714) more, but was more effective, resulting in 1749 more patients accurately diagnosed and 91 fewer deaths compared to the two-step algorithm. Additionally, the NAAT alone pathway costed JPY 26,146 (USD 281) less per true positive CDI diagnosed. The total budget impact, and cost per CDI diagnosed was most sensitive to GDH sensitivity in one-way sensitivity analysis, where a lower GDH sensitivity resulted in greater cost savings with the NAAT alone pathway.

REBYOTA™ (fecal microbiota, live-jslm [FMBL]) is a microbiota-based live biotherapeutic approved for the prevention of rCDI following antibiotic treatment for rCDI. We quantified the budget impact of FMBL during the first 3 years following introduction from a third-party US payer perspective. METHODS: A decision-tree model was used to estimate the budget impact of one-course FMBL by comparing costs under the scenario with FMBL to the scenario without FMBL (standard of care) in patients with one or more (≥ 1) recurrences after a primary episode of CDI and had completed ≥ 1 round of antibiotic treatments. Drug costs, rCDI-related medical costs, and budget impact over 1-3 years were estimated in 2022 US dollars. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For an insurance plan with a population size of 1,000,000, 468 patients per year were estimated to have ≥ 1 rCDI. The budget impact of one-course FMBL at $9000/course was cost-saving at an» average of -$0.0039 on a per-member-per-month (PMPM) basis, an average of -$8.30 on a per-treated-member-per-month (PTMPM) basis, and a total of -$139,865 on a plan level assuming 5%, 15%, and 20% of patients receive FMBL over 1-3 years, respectively. The scenario with FMBL entry was associated with higher drug costs (difference at $0.0474 PMPM; $101.26 PTMPM; $1,706,445 total plan) and lower rCDI-related medical costs (difference at -$0.0513 PMPM; -$109.56 PTMPM; -$1,846,309 total plan). The budget impact of FMBL in patients at first rCDI was cost-saving at -$0.0139 PMPM, -$84.78 PTMPM, corresponding to an annual savings of $500,022. CONCLUSIONS: FMBL has a cost-saving budget impact for a US payer, with higher initial drug costs being offset by savings in rCDI-related medical costs.

Our model considered FMBL vs. SOC only as proxied by the placebo arm of the PUNCH CD3 trial following a course of antibiotic treatment. In clinical practice, incremental antibiotics or other therapeutic options could have been considered and used sooner, which may result in treatment effectiveness rates different from the SOC efficacy rates in the PUNCH CD3 trial (and may also have a subsequent impact on drug costs). Sensitivity analyses by varying efficacy rates of FMBL and SOC allowed us to test the robustness of the model findings. Even with an assumed higher efficacy rate for SOC (i.e., the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval), the budget impact of FMBL is expected to be small (0.0357 PMPM). Further research may consider using real-world efficacy data to confirm the model findings when such data are available. Our model also assumed a three-node decision tree with critical time points at week 8 and month 6 to reflect the clinical trial design and thus data availability from the trial. In practice, physicians could evaluate treatment success or failure at different times and hence deviate the HRU and costs for rCDI from our model estimates. The model was developed from a US third-party payer perspective, and the findings may not be generalizable to specific payers. For example, their patient population (e.g., age distribution) and market shares might differ from the model assumptions. The medical costs considered in this model came from the literature, including the unit prices for medical services. The actual values could differ for a specific payer. For example, WAC prices were used to calculate drug acquisition costs. Such prices may not reflect the actual costs borne by the payer. Future studies should evaluate the budget impact of FMBL among different types of payers. Additionally, the distribution of vancomycin use vs. fidaxomicin use as the subsequent antibiotic treatment was assumed to be constant over 3 years after FMBL introduction, and assumptions on the projected market uptake of FMBL are yet to be tested when more data from the real world become available. Lastly, treatments that are not approved by the FDA or have limited use in real-world practice (e.g., fecal microbiota transplant [FMT], bezlotoxumab) were not considered in our study [""",Discussion

10476813,Seyedifar M,Budget impact analysis of temocillin insurance coverage for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens in Iran,Medicine (Baltimore),2023.0,"- BACKGROUND: One of the most prevalent infections with a significant disease burden is urinary tract infections (UTIs), which occurs in approximately 50% of women at least once in their lifetime. Antimicrobial resistance to pathogens causing UTIs is expanding worldwide and has been associated with increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including carbapenems, leading to significant costs for insurance and healthcare systems. The emergence of resistance to carbapenems has led to an increasing need for and interest in carbapenem-sparing strategies, including the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as temocillin. Temocillin has a strong bactericidal effect, along with high tolerability and a good safety profile. It is also stable toward most extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). The purpose of our study was to design a budget impact analysis (BIA) model and estimate the budget impact of temocillin insurance coverage for the treatment of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing bacteria from the perspective of the payer. METHODS: The BIA model with insurance payer perspective was used to estimate the impact of temocillin insurance coverage on the treatment of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing bacteria over a 1-year time horizon in Iran. Direct medicine costs, hospitalization and paraclinical costs, and side effect costs were considered in this model. To assess the impact of uncertainty on the model inputs, 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that inclusion of temocillin in insurance coverage, decreasing treatment costs from $36 million to $34 million, will result in overall savings of > $1.9 million and lead to > $9 million savings in insurance costs for antimicrobial resistance.

12038200,Inshasi J,Cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in the United Arab Emirates,Ther Adv Neurol Disord,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, associated with demyelination and inflammation. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) encompass all patients with MS experiencing relapses. While there is currently no cure for MS, the introduction of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) has significantly reduced the risk of relapse and disability in patients with MS. There is a high unmet need for an easy-to-administer DMT that can be used early in the treatment pathway. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab compared with other commonly used DMTs for the treatment of RMS from a health payer perspective in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A Markov model, based on expanded disability status scale (EDSS) health states, was developed using the UAE payer's perspective and a 65-year time horizon. The baseline patient distribution across the EDSS states was aligned to the population of ASCLEPIOS I and II trials. The British Columbia database informed natural history transition probabilities. Treatment effects were applied by delaying disability progression and reducing the number of relapses and were sourced from a network meta-analysis. The health care resource utilization was derived from interviews with local experts, who also validated the model structure and comparators, and utility inputs from published studies. In the absence of an officially defined willingness-to-pay threshold in the UAE, it was assumed to be United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) 369,854 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), which is twice the UAE gross domestic product per capita. RESULTS: Base-case results indicated that ofatumumab was dominant over ocrelizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab intravenous; was more cost-effective compared with teriflunomide, fingolimod (generic), glatiramer acetate, interferons, and best supportive care; and resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AED 713,068 per QALY versus cladribine.

Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) encompass all patients with MS experiencing relapses. While there is currently no cure for MS, the introduction of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) has significantly reduced the risk of relapse and disability in patients with MS. There is a high unmet need for an easy-to-administer DMT that can be used early in the treatment pathway. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab compared with other commonly used DMTs for the treatment of RMS from a health payer perspective in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A Markov model, based on expanded disability status scale (EDSS) health states, was developed using the UAE payer's perspective and a 65-year time horizon.

10571281,Aungsumart S,Rituximab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in Thailand: an economic evaluation and budget impact analysis,BMC Health Serv Res,2023.0,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelination process in the central nervous system (CNS) causing neurological disability and poor quality of life. Currently, Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying therapy is costly, and most patients with multiple sclerosis are ineligible for treatment in Thailand as previous studies have challenged its cost-effectiveness. Off-label use of rituximab is inexpensive and highly effective in treating multiple sclerosis, but evidence of its cost-effectiveness in Thailand is yet to be collected. METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and budget impact of rituximab for multiple sclerosis treatment compared with best supportive care, the standard practice in Thailand to treat the disease. A Markov model with a one-month cycle length and lifetime horizon was applied to compare the costs and outcomes of rituximab and best supportive care based on a societal perspective. Accordingly, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate parameter uncertainty. In addition, the Markov model was used to assess the 5-year budget impact from the government perspective. RESULTS: A rituximab biosimilar demonstrated higher effectiveness and lower associated costs, compared to best supportive care, with the highest probability of being cost-effective (96%). The probability of relapse was the most sensitive parameter according to the one-way sensitivity analysis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the cost-utility of adding SGLT2i to the standard treatment for T2D-HF patients in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model with 3-month cycles and a lifetime horizon was conducted from a societal perspective. Efficacy data came from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Transition probabilities and direct medical costs were derived from the National Health Security Office database, while direct non-medical costs and utility were collected through patient interviews at Siriraj hospital to reflect Thailand's context. The main outcomes were incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A sensitivity and budget impact analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Canagliflozin led to the highest increase in QALYs, at 1.21 years, followed by dapagliflozin (0.54 years) and empagliflozin (0.06 years).

Published NASH cost-effectiveness models (CEMs) are heterogeneous and consistently omit comorbid conditions that frequently co-exist alongside NASH. We aimed to develop a de novo CEM framework that incorporates extra-hepatic disease states and outcomes alongside hepatic components to enable future estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions. Methods: Patient-level simulation and cohort-level Markov models were implemented in the same framework. Model inputs included fibrosis progression; late-stage liver disease outcomes; comorbidity outcomes for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; mortality; health-related quality of life; and direct medical costs. The prototype analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid versus standard of care from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon with costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. However, the CEM was designed for easy adaptation to other countries, time horizons, and other considerations. Efficacy and adverse event parameters were obtained from the 18-month interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial. Outputs include total and incremental costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years. Results: In this model, total costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years were all higher with obeticholic acid compared with standard of care. Cross-validation of this model with the 2016 and 2020 Institute for Clinical and Economic Review models revealed marked differences, mainly driven by mortality inputs, transition probability estimates, and incorporation of the effect of treatment and comorbidities. Conclusion: This is the first CEM in NASH to incorporate the clinical consequences of several comorbidities.

Published NASH cost-effectiveness models (CEMs) are heterogeneous and consistently omit comorbid conditions that frequently co-exist alongside NASH. We aimed to develop a de novo CEM framework that incorporates extra-hepatic disease states and outcomes alongside hepatic components to enable future estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions. Methods: Patient-level simulation and cohort-level Markov models were implemented in the same framework. Model inputs included fibrosis progression; late-stage liver disease outcomes; comorbidity outcomes for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; mortality; health-related quality of life; and direct medical costs. The prototype analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid versus standard of care from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon with costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. However, the CEM was designed for easy adaptation to other countries, time horizons, and other considerations.

Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) represent a significant disease and economic burden in Colombia. Assessing the economic evaluation of available treatments is essential for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using faricimab for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD within the Colombian health system. Methods: This study used a 25-year Markov cohort model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of faricimab vs aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab.

This study's focal point is to measure the relative cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the symptomatic approach compared to the existing approach of TB screening (consisted of both symptomatic and asymptomatic screening) among high-risk groups in Malaysia. METHOD: The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) was measured using a decision tree model and the outcome is presented in terms of cost per TB case detected and the ICER. Analysis was conducted using secondary data collected from the Disease Control Division, Sabah and Sarawak State Health Departments. The robustness of the model is determined by Deterministic and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis. Subsequently, Budget impact over 5 years period, from 2018 to 2022 was estimated for both approaches. RESULTS: The symptomatic approach was more cost-effective than the existing approach with ICER of MYR 424.71. The cost of conducting Sputum for Acid Fast Bacilli (SAFB) was found as the key driver for ICER. Budget Impact Analysis showed that switching from the existing approach towards the symptomatic approach would result in a cost-saving of MYR 65.5 million over 5 years. However, this would lead to 4473 TB cases being undetected over the same duration. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the policymakers have to weigh the trade-off between cost-saving and TB case detection.

9574700,Mohd Hassan NZ,A symptomatic approach to tuberculosis screening for high-risk groups in Malaysia: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,J Clin Tuberc Other Mycobact Dis,2022.0,"- BACKGROUND: One of the crucial areas of eliminating TB is the early detection of cases through the screening programme. This study's focal point is to measure the relative cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the symptomatic approach compared to the existing approach of TB screening (consisted of both symptomatic and asymptomatic screening) among high-risk groups in Malaysia. METHOD: The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) was measured using a decision tree model and the outcome is presented in terms of cost per TB case detected and the ICER. Analysis was conducted using secondary data collected from the Disease Control Division, Sabah and Sarawak State Health Departments. The robustness of the model is determined by Deterministic and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis. Subsequently, Budget impact over 5 years period, from 2018 to 2022 was estimated for both approaches. RESULTS: The symptomatic approach was more cost-effective than the existing approach with ICER of MYR 424.71. The cost of conducting Sputum for Acid Fast Bacilli (SAFB) was found as the key driver for ICER. Budget Impact Analysis showed that switching from the existing approach towards the symptomatic approach would result in a cost-saving of MYR 65.5 million over 5 years. However, this would lead to 4473 TB cases being undetected over the same duration. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the policymakers have to weigh the trade-off between cost-saving and TB case detection. This cost-saving can be channelled to new TB intervention programme with a higher chance of TB case detection.

The TB screening related costs from MOH perspective were calculated based on the capital (such as machineries plus their yearly maintenance and calibrations), personnel (such as yearly salary and allowances for staffs involved) and consumables (such as include the X-ray film, chemicals, personal protective equipment and others) involved. A mix of step down and Activity Based Costing (ABC) were implemented for costs estimation. Expert opinion was used to allocate the costs. The allocation of capital and personnel costs were based on duration of the respective screening procedure.

11430509,Zhang X,Budget impact analysis of high-priced orphan medicinal products intended for the treatment of rare diseases in China: evidence from a densely populated metropolis of Chengdu,BMC Health Serv Res,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: An increasing number of orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are being included in social health insurance schemes, significantly improving access to medicines for patients with rare diseases. However, high-priced OMPs are still not covered, primarily due to health equity controversies and inadequate data systems required for economic evaluation. The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of drug expenditures and the size of the reimbursement budget required for high-priced OMPs from the perspectives of society and healthcare payers. METHODS: The study performed a budget impact analysis using data from multiple sources to estimate the reimbursement budget for high-priced OMPs in Chengdu, a densely populated metropolis in China. The budget analysis consisted of three main elements: the number of patients, the price of drugs, and the simulated policy scenario. By adjusting the combinations of these elements, the budget fluctuations for payers were estimated. Furthermore, the study predicted the budget trend for the next three years to validate its sustainability. RESULTS: The analysis indicated that 98 rare disease patients in Chengdu required high-priced OMPs in 2019. This suggested a projected budget of CNY 179 million for these patients without reimbursement policies, from a societal perspective. Under six assumed policy scenarios, this budget ranged from CNY 32 million to CNY 156 million.

11430509,Zhang X,Budget impact analysis of high-priced orphan medicinal products intended for the treatment of rare diseases in China: evidence from a densely populated metropolis of Chengdu,BMC Health Serv Res,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: An increasing number of orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are being included in social health insurance schemes, significantly improving access to medicines for patients with rare diseases. However, high-priced OMPs are still not covered, primarily due to health equity controversies and inadequate data systems required for economic evaluation. The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of drug expenditures and the size of the reimbursement budget required for high-priced OMPs from the perspectives of society and healthcare payers. METHODS: The study performed a budget impact analysis using data from multiple sources to estimate the reimbursement budget for high-priced OMPs in Chengdu, a densely populated metropolis in China. The budget analysis consisted of three main elements: the number of patients, the price of drugs, and the simulated policy scenario. By adjusting the combinations of these elements, the budget fluctuations for payers were estimated. Furthermore, the study predicted the budget trend for the next three years to validate its sustainability. RESULTS: The analysis indicated that 98 rare disease patients in Chengdu required high-priced OMPs in 2019. This suggested a projected budget of CNY 179 million for these patients without reimbursement policies, from a societal perspective. Under six assumed policy scenarios, this budget ranged from CNY 32 million to CNY 156 million. Over the next three years, the annual budget was estimated to range from CNY 200 million to CNY 1.303 billion. CONCLUSION: Integration of multi-source data helps to obtain more scientifically reliable results on budget impacts. The study found that the budgetary impacts of high-priced OMPs on society and payers are relatively limited. Health policymakers can choose appropriate reimbursement strategies based on financial affordability among a diverse mix of elements.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of UTIs associated with low fluid intake in women versus a strategy of primary prevention by increasing water intake. Model inputs were based on randomized controlled trial data which found that increasing water intake by 1.5 L/day decreased the risk of developing cystitis by 48% in women with low fluid intake and recurrent UTI.

First, our analysis considered multiple outcomes (cost-effectiveness and budget impact) across multiple countries, demonstrating the value of increased water intake across different healthcare systems with varying costs. Second, our study population included only those who would benefit from the increasing water intake strategy, by targeting women with recurrent UTI and low fluid intake. We also considered that behavior change takes time, thus, we evaluated different proportions of the population adhering to the increased water intake strategy through compliances of 10%, 50% and 80%. Finally, our study may be considered conservative as the larger impact of reduced health care resources in the context of the health system were not considered; future research may wish to quantify this impact. Our study also has limitations. As noted above, risk reduction values were based on a single long-term randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of increasing water intake on UTI risk; to the best of our knowledge, this is the only available long-term evidence available. Further research should be performed to assess impact of increased water intake in other settings with variable geography and economic conditions. The countries we selected were high-income and upper-middle-income countries, which may limit generalizability to low-income countries. As UTI-specific quality of life measures were not available, we used generic health-related quality of life measures; it is unlikely that these utility measures would greatly differ, thus resulting in minimal impact on the results. Further, costs related to the implementation of public health awareness and prevention programs were not considered in our analysis; the cost of such programs or initiatives should be assessed in the future. There is also a possibility that the economic impact of increased water intake was underestimated in the current manuscript. First, to calculate our target population we used a conservative estimation of recurrent UTI prevalence based on the French population as prevalence of recurrent UTI in regions other than the USA and France are not available in the scientific literature. Secondly, to calculate the total number of UTIs per country we used the number of recurrent UTI episodes experienced in the general female population. As our target population included only women who are low drinkers, it is likely that these women experience a higher-than-average number of recurrent UTI episodes as compared to the general female population. Taking into consideration our conservative calculation for both the target population and number of UTI episodes per country, increased water intake may have a greater economic impact then as reported here.""",Discussion

The survival of relapsed patients has been greatly improved by the development of novel drugs such as lenalidomide and bortezomib. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of these drugs as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients in the South African public health care system. METHODS: We modelled 3 treatment strategies for second-line RRMM treatment: dexamethasone (standard of care), bortezomib (BORT) and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (LEN/DEX) from the South African public health perspective. For each strategy we modelled a hypothetical cohort of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients using a three-state Markov model over a 15-year time horizon. Efficacy and utilization data were obtained from the MM009/010 and APEX trials and external studies. Price and cost data were from local sources and presented in 2021 South African Rands. Outcomes were reported in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for BORT and LEN/DEX and compared to a local cost-effectiveness threshold of R38 500 per DALY averted using the assumption that 1 DALY averted is equal to 1 QALY gained. A budget impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial impact of the introduction of BORT and LEN/DEX, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The modelled total costs of DEX, BORT and LEN/DEX were estimated to be R8 312, R234 996 and R1 135 323, respectively. DEX treatment provided 1.14 QALYs while BORT and LEN/DEX treatments provided 1.49 and 2.22 QALYs, respectively.

9746097,Matsela LM,Cost utility and budget impact analysis of dexamethasone compared with bortezomib and lenalidomide for the treatment of second line multiple myeloma from a South African public health perspective,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2022.0,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is an incurable haematological malignancy that is associated with a high probability of relapse. The survival of relapsed patients has been greatly improved by the development of novel drugs such as lenalidomide and bortezomib. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of these drugs as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients in the South African public health care system. METHODS: We modelled 3 treatment strategies for second-line RRMM treatment: dexamethasone (standard of care), bortezomib (BORT) and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (LEN/DEX) from the South African public health perspective. For each strategy we modelled a hypothetical cohort of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients using a three-state Markov model over a 15-year time horizon. Efficacy and utilization data were obtained from the MM009/010 and APEX trials and external studies. Price and cost data were from local sources and presented in 2021 South African Rands. Outcomes were reported in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for BORT and LEN/DEX and compared to a local cost-effectiveness threshold of R38 500 per DALY averted using the assumption that 1 DALY averted is equal to 1 QALY gained. A budget impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial impact of the introduction of BORT and LEN/DEX, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The modelled total costs of DEX, BORT and LEN/DEX were estimated to be R8 312, R234 996 and R1 135 323, respectively. DEX treatment provided 1.14 QALYs while BORT and LEN/DEX treatments provided 1.49 and 2.22 QALYs, respectively. The ICER of BORT versus DEX was R654 649 and that of LEN/DEX versus BORT was R1 225 542. Both BORT and LEN/DEX treatments were not cost-effective relative to a cost-effectiveness threshold of R38 500 per DALY averted. Both BORT and LEN/DEX significantly increase the 1 year budget-cost of RRMM treatment. CONCLUSION: Both BORT and LEN/DEX treatments are unlikely to be cost-effective strategies for second-line treatment of RRMM in South Africa.

Since 2021, an inactivated, quadrivalent high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD) has been recommended for persons aged 60 years and over. The aim of this study was to calculate the impact of vaccinating the German population aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) with regard to health outcomes and costs. METHODS: An age-stratified deterministic compartment model was built to simulate the course of influenza infection for the German population in the season 2019/20. Probabilities for health outcomes and cost data were searched from the literature and were used to compare the influenza-related health and economic effects for different scenarios. Perspectives were those of the statutory health insurance and the society. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: From the statutory health insurance perspective, vaccinating the German population aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD would have prevented 277,026 infections (- 1.1%) with an increase of overall direct costs of €224 million (+ 40.1%) compared with IIV4-SD. A separate analysis showed that increased vaccination of 75% (World Health Organization recommendation for older age groups) in persons aged 60 years and over using IIV4-SD only would prevent 1,289,648 infections (- 5.1%) and would save costs from a statutory health insurance perspective of €103 million (- 13.2%) compared with IIV4-HD at actual vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: The modeling approach offers important insights into the epidemiological and budgetary impact of different vaccination scenarios.

Access to biosimilars has also resulted in downward repricing of reference drugs in Poland. This applies with the greatest extent to ETN, and less to INF and ADA (data not presented in detail). However, this scenario is not replicated on a similar level in other countries and likely depends on a variety of factors (eg, local economic policy, healthcare system construction). Notably, despite having the shortest presence on the market, the greatest savings are generated by ADA, which is likely the least expensive TNFi treatment.

10977723,Lopes da Silva Filho A,Etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant: Budget impact analysis based on the Brazilian private healthcare system,PLoS One,2024.0,"- High rates of unplanned pregnancies persist despite pharmacological developments and advancements in contraceptive methods. Here, we demonstrate that the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant (IMP-ETN) may be an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) for women in Brazil. For our pharmacoeconomic analysis, we reviewed the literature on IMP-ETN regarding its acceptance, eligibility criteria, choice, relations with age, adverse events and, finally, the unmet need in the fee-for-service private healthcare sector. We considered qualitative observations in combination with quantitative analysis and performed a deterministic sensitivity analysis to investigate whether this technology can be self-sustainable over a period of five years. The target population for this analysis comprised 158,696 women. Compared with the continued use of LNG-IUSs, adopting the IMP-ETN can result in a cost avoidance of $ 7.640.804,02 in the first year and $ 82,455,254.43 in five years. Disseminating information among physicians will promote this change and strengthen the potential cost avoided by private health system payers. These savings can be used to improve other healthcare programs and strategies. Moreover, the principles of care can be promoted by improving and adapting healthcare systems and expanding treatment and follow-up strategies. This would also provide support to women's reproductive rights and improve their quality of life. Our results suggest that the IMP-ETN has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile. Given all its advantages and negative incremental cost impact over a period of five years, the IMP-ETN may be a more favorable alternative to LNG-IUSs. Therefore, it should be offered to beneficiaries with a private healthcare plan.

10893703,Dams J,Budget impact analysis of a Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program for older people in Germany: a Markov model based on data from the LiFE-is-LiFE trial,BMC Geriatr,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: Fall prevention is important for healthy ageing, but the economic impact of fall prevention are scarcely investigated. A recent cost-effectiveness analysis compared a group-delivered Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise Program (gLiFE) with an individually-delivered program (LiFE) in community-dwelling people (aged ≥ 70 years) at risk of falling. In addition, the current study aimed to analyze the budget impact of LiFE and gLiFE, compared with standard care in Germany. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to reflect falls and associated care needs for community-dwelling persons over 5 years. The intervention effects of LiFE and gLiFE were shown to be equivalent in a non-inferiority trial, although the costs differed. Outpatient, inpatient, and intervention costs were assessed from a payer's perspective. The effect of parameter uncertainty was assessed in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The budget impact due to intervention costs was €510 million for LiFE and €186 million for gLiFE. Over five years, health care expenditures were €35,008 million for those receiving standard care, €35,416 million for those receiving LiFE, and €35,091 million for persons receiving gLiFE. Thereby, LiFE and gLiFE could prevent 2700 deaths and 648,000 falls over 5 years. Parameter uncertainties in the risk of falling, uptake of an intervention offer, and in the intervention effects had a major influence; thus cost savings for LiFE and gLiFE compared with standard care could be achieved for individuals with a high risk of falling. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that cost savings for LiFE and gLiFE compared with standard care could only be achieved for individuals at high risk of falling, with gLiFE being superior to LiFE.

11849414,Siegfried C,Using QIP-MS to Guide the Timing of MRD Testing in Patients With Multiple Myeloma: A Budget Impact Analysis From the French Payer Perspective,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025.0,"- Purpose: Serum or urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP or UPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE or UIFE) are routinely used to detect M-proteins in MM patients. However, SPEP and SIFE are not sensitive enough to measure M-protein levels that are low but still clinically significant. This study aimed to evaluate the potential cost savings associated with using the EXENT GAM Assay, a serum-based quantitative-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (QIP-MS) diagnostic test instead of SIFE to guide the timing of minimal residual disease (MRD) testing for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: A simple 2-year budget impact model was created in Excel using data from MM clinical trials and fee schedules. Patients are tested with either QIP-MS or SIFE at predetermined timepoints. If patients test negative, they will receive MRD testing. The result of the MRD test will determine if the preceding serum-based test was a true negative result (MRD test is negative) or a false negative result (MRD test is positive). Patients receiving autologous stem cell transplant (henceforth referred to as transplant) and those not receiving transplant are both eligible for one MRD test per year. MRD testing for transplant-eligible patients occurs prior to transplant and one year following transplant. Results: Across a hypothetical population of 5154 mm patients receiving 1st-line treatment in France, using QIP-MS instead of SIFE prior to MRD testing leads to 1973 fewer false negative results and 744 more false positive results (due, in part, to the detection of residual IgG).

The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of universal opt-out HBV and HCV testing in EDs based on 2 long-term studies of the real-world effectiveness of testing in 2 large ED's in the UK. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate ED-based HBV and HCV testing versus no ED testing, in addition to current testing practice. The two EDs had a HBV HBsAg prevalence of 0.5-0.9% and an HCV RNA prevalence of 0.9-1.0%. The analysis was performed from a UK health service perspective, over a lifetime time horizon. Costs are reported in British pounds (GBP), and outcomes as quality adjusted life years (QALYs), with both discounted at 3.5% per year.

The cost-effectiveness was estimated for both infections, in both ED's. RESULTS: HBV and HCV testing were highly cost-effective in both settings, with ICERs ranging from £7,177 to £12,387 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, HBV testing was 89-94% likely to be cost-effective at the threshold, while HCV testing was 94-100% likely to be cost-effective, across both settings.

In the pivotal clinical trial named DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, CV death and kidney disease progression compared to placebo in a population of T2D patients. This study evaluated the health and economic impact of dapagliflozin for T2D patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the Italian GPs setting. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to assess the health and economic impact of introducing dapagliflozin in GPs setting. The analysis was conducted by adopting the Italian NHS perspective and a 3-year time horizon. The model estimated and compared the health outcomes and direct medical costs associated with a scenario with dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic therapies available for GPs prescription (scenario B) and a scenario where only other antidiabetic therapies are available (scenario A). Rates of occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complications as well as adverse events were captured from DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and the literature, while cost data were retrieved from the Italian tariff and the literature. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of model parameters on the budget impact. RESULTS: The model estimated around 442.000 patients eligible for the treatment with dapagliflozin in the GPs setting for each simulated year.

11881394,Goudarzi Z,Value of cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment for Lennox Gastaut syndrome: cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,BMC Med,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. METHODS: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated.

11881394,Goudarzi Z,Value of cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment for Lennox Gastaut syndrome: cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,BMC Med,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. METHODS: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated.

Guidelines recommend immunoglobulin (IG) therapy as an immunomodulatory agent in CIDP. Drawbacks and unmet needs with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) include adverse effects and wear-off effects, along with the burden of administration based on site of care. Subcutaneous administration of Hizentra, a subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) reduces patient burden by allowing self-administration outside the hospital setting and has fewer adverse events (AEs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the expected cost of treatment and the budget impact of Hizentra compared with IVIG for maintenance treatment of CIDP in the United States. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to estimate the expected budget impact of maintenance treatment with Hizentra for US stakeholders. The model adopts primarily a US integrated delivery network perspective and, secondarily, a commercial perspective over a 1-year time horizon. Pharmacy costs were based on a payment mix of average sales price (73%), wholesale acquisition cost (2%), and average wholesale price (25%). Costs in the model reflect 2022 US dollars. In accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines and recommendations for budget impact modeling, no discounting was performed. The PATH clinical study of Hizentra maintenance in CIDP was used to determine clinical inputs for relapse rates at initial assessment (24 weeks) and at 52 weeks for Hizentra. The ICE clinical study of Gamunex maintenance in CIDP was the basis of relapse rates for Gamunex (and other IVIGs). Literature-based estimates were obtained for infusion costs by site of care, costs of IVIG infusion-related complications, and significant IVIG AE rates. Hizentra AE rates from the US Hizentra prescribing information were assessed but were not included in the model as the AEs in CIDP were mild, easily treated, and self-limited. Sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate variations from the base case. RESULTS: The model showed that a Hizentra starting dose of 0.2 g/kg is expected to result in annual cost savings of US$32,447 per patient compared with IVIG. For a hypothetical 25-million-member plan, the budget impact of a 10% market share shift from IVIG to Hizentra is expected to result in savings of US$2,296,235.

Guidelines recommend immunoglobulin (IG) therapy as an immunomodulatory agent in CIDP. Drawbacks and unmet needs with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) include adverse effects and wear-off effects, along with the burden of administration based on site of care. Subcutaneous administration of Hizentra, a subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) reduces patient burden by allowing self-administration outside the hospital setting and has fewer adverse events (AEs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the expected cost of treatment and the budget impact of Hizentra compared with IVIG for maintenance treatment of CIDP in the United States. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to estimate the expected budget impact of maintenance treatment with Hizentra for US stakeholders. The model adopts primarily a US integrated delivery network perspective and, secondarily, a commercial perspective over a 1-year time horizon. Pharmacy costs were based on a payment mix of average sales price (73%), wholesale acquisition cost (2%), and average wholesale price (25%). Costs in the model reflect 2022 US dollars. In accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines and recommendations for budget impact modeling, no discounting was performed. The PATH clinical study of Hizentra maintenance in CIDP was used to determine clinical inputs for relapse rates at initial assessment (24 weeks) and at 52 weeks for Hizentra. The ICE clinical study of Gamunex maintenance in CIDP was the basis of relapse rates for Gamunex (and other IVIGs). Literature-based estimates were obtained for infusion costs by site of care, costs of IVIG infusion-related complications, and significant IVIG AE rates. Hizentra AE rates from the US Hizentra prescribing information were assessed but were not included in the model as the AEs in CIDP were mild, easily treated, and self-limited. Sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate variations from the base case. RESULTS: The model showed that a Hizentra starting dose of 0.2 g/kg is expected to result in annual cost savings of US$32,447 per patient compared with IVIG. For a hypothetical 25-million-member plan, the budget impact of a 10% market share shift from IVIG to Hizentra is expected to result in savings of US$2,296,235.

11129834,Moiana Uetela DA,Cost‐Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of the Implementation of Differentiated Service Delivery Models for HIV Treatment in Mozambique: a Modelling Study,J Int AIDS Soc,2024.0,"- INTRODUCTION: In 2018, the Mozambique Ministry of Health launched guidelines for implementing differentiated service delivery models (DSDMs) to optimize HIV service delivery, improve retention in care, and ultimately reduce HIV-associated mortality. The models were fast-track, 3-month antiretrovirals dispensing, community antiretroviral therapy groups, adherence clubs, family approach and three one-stop shop models: adolescent-friendly health services, maternal and child health, and tuberculosis. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis to compare these models to conventional services. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model based on the percentage of enrolment in each model and the probability of the outcome (12-month retention in treatment) for each year of the study period-three for the cost-effectiveness analysis (2019-2021) and three for the budget impact analysis (2022-2024). Costs for these analyses were primarily estimated per client-year from the health system perspective. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Budget impact analysis costs included antiretrovirals, laboratory tests and service provision interactions. Cost-effectiveness analysis additionally included start-up, training and clients' opportunity costs. Effectiveness was estimated using an uncontrolled interrupted time series analysis comparing the outcome before and after the implementation of the differentiated models.

The models were fast-track, 3-month antiretrovirals dispensing, community antiretroviral therapy groups, adherence clubs, family approach and three one-stop shop models: adolescent-friendly health services, maternal and child health, and tuberculosis. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis to compare these models to conventional services. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model based on the percentage of enrolment in each model and the probability of the outcome (12-month retention in treatment) for each year of the study period-three for the cost-effectiveness analysis (2019-2021) and three for the budget impact analysis (2022-2024). Costs for these analyses were primarily estimated per client-year from the health system perspective. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Budget impact analysis costs included antiretrovirals, laboratory tests and service provision interactions. Cost-effectiveness analysis additionally included start-up, training and clients' opportunity costs.

METHODS: The budget impact analysis (BIA) model over a period of 5 years was used to estimate the net budget impact (NBI) of IGlar treatment by comparing the total budget expenditures under two scenarios: scenario 1 involved only NPH insulin and scenario 2 included the introduction of IGlar. The total budget included either the cost of insulin or a combination of the costs of insulin and the expense related to severe hypoglycemia. Scenario 2 started at 20% uptake of IGlar and a yearly increase of 20%. NBI was calculated as the difference between the total budgets of scenarios 1 and 2. NBI and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for evaluation. RESULTS: Considering only the cost of insulin, the use of IGlar for patients with T2D and severe hypoglycemia resulted in a yearly average NBI of 174.9 million Thai baht (THB) (5.1 million USD). However, when the cost related to severe hypoglycemia was included, the total budget incurred from scenario 2 was less than that of scenario 1, leading to a negative NBI or cost savings.

While originators such as adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, and golimumab are available in Saudi Arabia, they were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of comparative efficacy data against infliximab SC. This lack of data restricts our ability to comprehensively evaluate these treatments in relation to infliximab SC. Additionally, the model employed in our study does not incorporate switching practices. This limitation arises from the absence of real-world data on patterns of switching between different versions of infliximab in Saudi Arabia. The dynamics of treatment switching are complex and can significantly impact economic outcomes, but the current analysis does not account for this aspect. Furthermore, the study does not assess productivity costs. This omission is attributed to the unavailability of data required to estimate such costs. While productivity costs are a relevant factor in the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions, their absence in our study reflects a data constraint. These limitations underscore the need for ongoing research and real-world data collection to enhance the precision and comprehensiveness of economic evaluations in the context of inflammatory bowel disease treatments in Saudi Arabia.""",Discussion

METHODS: Herein, we report updated survival data, post-progression management, cost/effectiveness and budget impact (BI) of osimertinib compared with a RW population receiving gefitinib or erlotinib. RESULTS: Overall, 189 Caucasian patients receiving first-line osimertinib were included. After a follow-up of 20.7 months, 74(39.2%) patients discontinued osimertinib, median time-to-treatment discontinuation (mTTD) was 27.9 months, overall survival 36.8 months. At progression, tissue biopsy was performed in 29 (56.9%), liquid biopsy in 15 (29.4%) and both in 7 (13.7%) cases. The most frequent resistant mechanism was MET amplification (N = 14, 29.8%). At data cutoff, 13 (6.9%) patients were continuing osimertinib beyond progression; 52 (67.5%) received second-line treatment; no further treatments were administered in 25 (32.5%) cases. Thirty-three (63.4%) patients received chemotherapy, 12(23.1%) TKIs combination. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a total cost per patient based on RW mTTD of 98,957.34€, 21,726.28€ and 19,637.83€ for osimertinib, erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively.

Therefore, one of the aims of the Dutch government is to move care from in-hospital to out-of-hospital care settings. An example of an innovation where care is moved from a more specialised setting to a less specialised setting is the performance of an antenatal cardiotocography (aCTG) in primary midwife-led care. The aim of this study was to assess the budget impact of implementing aCTG for healthy pregnant women in midwife-led care compared with usual obstetrician-led care in the Netherlands. METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate the actual costs and reimbursement of aCTG performed in midwife-led care and obstetrician-led care (ie, base-case analysis) from the Dutch healthcare perspective. Epidemiological and healthcare utilisation data describing both care pathways were obtained from a prospective cohort, survey and national databases. Different implementation rates of aCTG in midwife-led care were explored. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the budget impact estimates. RESULTS: Shifting aCTG from obstetrician-led care to midwife-led-care would increase actual costs with €311 763 (97.5% CI €188 574 to €426 072) and €1 247 052 (97.5% CI €754 296 to €1 704 290) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively, while it would decrease reimbursement with -€7 538 335 (97.5% CI -€10 302 306 to -€4 559 661) and -€30 153 342 (97.5% CI -€41 209 225 to -€18 238 645) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively.

METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate the actual costs and reimbursement of aCTG performed in midwife-led care and obstetrician-led care (ie, base-case analysis) from the Dutch healthcare perspective. Epidemiological and healthcare utilisation data describing both care pathways were obtained from a prospective cohort, survey and national databases. Different implementation rates of aCTG in midwife-led care were explored. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the budget impact estimates. RESULTS: Shifting aCTG from obstetrician-led care to midwife-led-care would increase actual costs with €311 763 (97.5% CI €188 574 to €426 072) and €1 247 052 (97.5% CI €754 296 to €1 704 290) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively, while it would decrease reimbursement with -€7 538 335 (97.5% CI -€10 302 306 to -€4 559 661) and -€30 153 342 (97.5% CI -€41 209 225 to -€18 238 645) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively.

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD-program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). METHODS: Patients (n = 59) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD-program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1-4 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD-program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD-program. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n = 33) decreased over time (M = 19.2 at T0, M = 15.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n = 26, M = 17.5 at T0, M = 15.9 at T6, p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD-program was estimated at 7-28 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the AD-program was not statistically significant in this RCT.

Such studies are scarce. Another strength is that the evaluation of the budget impact adds important knowledge to the literature on economic evaluations of psychological interventions for cancer patients. Limitations include that the study was partially conducted during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In this period the prevalence of AD seemed to have dropped, which hampered the inclusion process and resulted in an underpowered RCT. Another limitation is that the heterogeneous nature of the AD‐program precludes saying anything about the efficacy of the individual interventions offered within this program. A third limitation is that 36% of the patients were still receiving psychological treatment when the last assessment was scheduled. Therefore, the results of this study should be generalised with caution. Limitations of the budget impact analysis are that the results are limited to the Dutch health care system, and that a scenario with the cost of active screening for AD was not included. This scenario was not taken into account, because patients in usual care are usually not actively screened for AD.""",Limitations

11910135,Holtmaat K,Efficacy and Budget Impact of a Tailored Psychological Intervention Program Targeting Cancer Patients With Adjustment Disorder: A Randomised Controlled Trial,Psychooncology,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Evidence on the efficacy of psychological interventions targeting cancer patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder is scarce. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD-program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). METHODS: Patients (n = 59) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD-program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1-4 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD-program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD-program. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n = 33) decreased over time (M = 19.2 at T0, M = 15.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n = 26, M = 17.5 at T0, M = 15.9 at T6, p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD-program was estimated at 7-28 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the AD-program was not statistically significant in this RCT. Limitations include that this study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research on the efficacy and implementation of the AD-program is warranted.

To complete the economic analysis, there is a need to assess whether society can afford it. The objective of this study was to carry out a budget impact analysis of the use of Souvenaid in Spain under the conditions of the LipiDidiet clinical trial from a societal perspective. METHODS: We built a population model that took into account all the cohorts of individuals with AD, their individual progression, and the potential impact of Souvenaid treatment on their trajectories. Patient progression data were obtained from mixed models. The target population was estimated based on the population forecast for 2020-2035 and the incidence of dementia. Individual progression to dementia measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes was reproduced using mixed models. Besides the costs of treatment and diagnosis, direct costs of medical and non-medical care and indirect costs were included. RESULTS: The epidemiological indicators and the distribution of life expectancy by stages validated the model. From the third year (2022), the differences in the cost of dementia offset the incremental cost of diagnosis and treatment. The costs of dependency reached €500 million/year while those of the intervention were limited to €40 million. CONCLUSIONS: Souvenaid, with modest effectiveness in delaying dementia associated with AD, achieved a positive economic balance between costs and savings. Its use in the treatment of prodromal AD would imply an initial cost that would be ongoing, but this would be offset by savings in the care system for dependency associated with dementia from the third year.

10306161,Silas U,Fast In-House Next-Generation Sequencing in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Hospital Budget Impact Analysis,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2023.0,"- Background: Targeted therapy for cancer is becoming more frequent as the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis increases. Molecular testing must be done to use targeted therapy. Unfortunately, the testing turnaround time can delay the initiation of targeted therapy. Objective: To investigate the impact of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine in the hospital that would allow for in-house NGS testing of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in a US setting. Methods: The differences between 2 hospital pathways were established with a cohort-level decision tree that feeds into a Markov model. A pathway that used in-house NGS (75%) and the use of external laboratories (so-called send-out NGS) (25%), was compared with the standard of exclusively send-out NGS. The model was from the perspective of a US hospital over a 5-year time horizon. All cost input data were in or inflated to 2021 USD. Scenario analysis was done on key variables. Results: In a hospital with 500 mNSCLC patients, the implementation of in-house NGS was estimated to increase the testing costs and the revenue of the hospital. The model predicted a $710 060 increase in testing costs, a $1 732 506 increase in revenue, and a $1 022 446 return on investment over 5 years. The payback period was 15 months with in-house NGS. The number of patients on targeted therapy increased by 3.38%, and the average turnaround time decreased by 10 days when in-house NGS was used. Discussion: Reducing testing turnaround time is a benefit of in-house NGS. It could contribute to fewer mNSCLC patients lost to second opinion and an increased number of patients on targeted therapy. The model outcomes predicted that, over a 5-year period, there would be a positive return on investment for a US hospital. The model reflects a proposed scenario. The heterogeneity of hospital inputs and the cost of send-out NGS means context-specific inputs are needed. Conclusion: Using in-house NGS testing could reduce the testing turnaround time and increase the number of patients on targeted therapy. Additional benefits for the hospital are that fewer patients will be lost to second opinion and that in-house NGS could generate additional revenue.","Change in Revenue, Cost, and ROI for Each Year of the Time Horizon; Model Inputs; METHODS; Model Structure; BACKGROUND","Which section does this sentence belong to: ""The proposed scenario reduced the turnaround time by an estimated 10 days (median: 9.85; 95% CI: 9.13, 10.50 days).

Objective: To investigate the impact of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine in the hospital that would allow for in-house NGS testing of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in a US setting. Methods: The differences between 2 hospital pathways were established with a cohort-level decision tree that feeds into a Markov model.

Finally, data on ICU occupation in IE patients receiving intraoperative hemoadsorption are mixed and, although reporting improvements in patients’ outcomes, recent studies have not confirmed the reduction in ICU length of stay observed in the study used to inform this model, suggesting that further data are needed to confirm the validity of this model in a real-world setting [""",4.

Intraoperative hemoadsorption may diminish the risk of postoperative hyperinflammation with potential economic implications for intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. The present study aimed to theoretically investigate the budget impact of a reduced length of ICU stay in IE patients treated with intraoperative hemoadsorption in the German healthcare system. Data on ICU occupation were extrapolated from a retrospective study on IE patients treated with hemoadsorption. An Excel-based budget impact model was developed to simulate the patient course over the ICU stay. A base-case scenario without therapy reimbursement and a scenario with full therapy reimbursement were explored. The annual eligible German IE patient population was derived from official German Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) volume data. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the uncertainty over the model results. The use of intraoperative hemoadsorption resulted in EUR 2298 being saved per patient in the base-case scenario without therapy reimbursement. The savings increased to EUR 3804 per patient in the case of full device-specific reimbursement. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of savings, with a probability of savings of 87% and 99% in the base-case and full reimbursement scenario, respectively.

We previously evaluated the cost of preparing to implement Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), an individually tailored, evidence-based parenting program that takes a whole child approach, with effects on both behavioral health and health behavior outcomes, in primary care settings. This study estimates the cost of implementation, including preparation. METHODS: We assessed the cost of FCU4Health across the preparation and implementation phases spanning 32 months and 1 week (October 1, 2016-June 13, 2019) in a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study. This family-level randomized controlled trial took place in Arizona with n = 113 predominantly low-income, Latino families with children ages > 5.5 to < 13 years. Using electronic cost capture and time-based activity-driven methods, budget impact analysis from the perspective of a future FCU4Health adopting entity-namely, ambulatory pediatric care clinicians-was used to estimate the cost of implementation. Labor costs were based on 2021 Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics, NIH-directed salary cap levels or known salaries, plus fringe benefits at a standard rate of 30%. Non-labor costs were based on actual amounts spent from receipts and invoices. RESULTS: The cost of FCU4Health implementation to 113 families was $268,886 ($2380 per family). Actual per family cost varied widely, as individual tailoring resulted in families receiving a range of 1-15 sessions. The estimated cost of replicating implementation for future sites ranged from $37,636-$72,372 ($333-$641 per family). Using our previously reported preparation costs (i.e., $174,489; $1544 per family), with estimated replication costs of $18,524-$21,836 ($164-$193 per family), the total cost of delivering FCU4Health was $443,375 ($3924 per family), with total estimated replication costs of $56,160-$94,208 ($497-$834 per family). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline for costs associated with implementation of an individually tailored parenting program. Results provide critical information for decision makers and a model for future economic analysis and can be used to inform optimization thresholds for implementation and, when necessary, benchmarks for program adaptation to promote scale-up.

We previously evaluated the cost of preparing to implement Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), an individually tailored, evidence-based parenting program that takes a whole child approach, with effects on both behavioral health and health behavior outcomes, in primary care settings. This study estimates the cost of implementation, including preparation. METHODS: We assessed the cost of FCU4Health across the preparation and implementation phases spanning 32 months and 1 week (October 1, 2016-June 13, 2019) in a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study. This family-level randomized controlled trial took place in Arizona with n = 113 predominantly low-income, Latino families with children ages > 5.5 to < 13 years. Using electronic cost capture and time-based activity-driven methods, budget impact analysis from the perspective of a future FCU4Health adopting entity-namely, ambulatory pediatric care clinicians-was used to estimate the cost of implementation. Labor costs were based on 2021 Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics, NIH-directed salary cap levels or known salaries, plus fringe benefits at a standard rate of 30%. Non-labor costs were based on actual amounts spent from receipts and invoices. RESULTS: The cost of FCU4Health implementation to 113 families was $268,886 ($2380 per family). Actual per family cost varied widely, as individual tailoring resulted in families receiving a range of 1-15 sessions. The estimated cost of replicating implementation for future sites ranged from $37,636-$72,372 ($333-$641 per family). Using our previously reported preparation costs (i.e., $174,489; $1544 per family), with estimated replication costs of $18,524-$21,836 ($164-$193 per family), the total cost of delivering FCU4Health was $443,375 ($3924 per family), with total estimated replication costs of $56,160-$94,208 ($497-$834 per family).

Because we aligned study roles to BLS job codes, these estimates may deviate from true salaries. This limitation is unique to this implementation of FCU4Health; future adopters may have more concrete salary information with which to make more accurate projections. Second, labor cost estimates for CAB members who did not have a second role on the project were based solely on meeting attendance, which could have underestimated their contributions if they engaged in other activities supporting the project. Third, while time spent on specific implementation activities was recorded via weekly surveys by those involved, there could be some missing data despite efforts to follow-up and prompt respondents when no survey was submitted for a particular week. Thus, it is possible that these estimation methods may not fully capture effort spent on the project. Fourth, when calculating variable costs related to direct intervention delivery (e.g., travel costs, mileage reimbursement, facilitator/family meeting time), we imputed and applied mean value estimates for 21 families who had missing zip codes, based averages from the actual values for the 92 families with zip codes. These estimated costs comprised about 7% of the total implementation labor costs; therefore, we do not believe this imputation had a substantial effect on the overall cost estimate. Fifth, given this is the first implementation trial of FCU4Health, these results are best viewed as projections when applied to plan future efforts. Similar implementation costing of the program in subsequent efforts will be needed to estimate actual costs to future adopters.""",Limitations and future directions

Therefore, to ensure treatments are administered before the onset of severe complications, screening is important. In Canada, uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of screening has led to conflicting recommendations. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of one-time HCV screening. A state-transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact between a risk-based screening strategy (current-practice) and a one-time screening strategy on three different birth-cohorts.

Although this study uses the best available evidence, there are limitations. First of all, it is not known what an one-time HCV birth cohort screening program actually looks like in the Canadian context. Our analysis adopted two approaches: in the base-case, we assumed the one-time HCV birth cohort screening came from federal and provincial recommendations and clinicians therefore invited more patients to come forward for screening. In our scenario analysis, we assumed that additional costs would be incurred to bring people forward for screening through the use of a provincial HCV screening program. The impact of either approach on screening rates is largely informed by data from the US and limited to baby boomers. However, the full impact of these assumptions on cost-effectiveness has been extensively explored in our scenario analyses. Lastly, although our analysis concluded that one-time screening of selected birth cohorts can be cost-effective, however, the birth cohort composition may change significantly due to the continuous effort on linkage to care and treatment overtime, future updated and expanded analyses will be necessary.""",Strengths and limitations

10439170,Wong WW,A province-by-province cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis of one-time birth cohort screening of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Canada,Sci Rep,2023.0,"- Managing chronic hepatitis C is challenging, as the majority of those infected are asymptomatic. Therefore, to ensure treatments are administered before the onset of severe complications, screening is important. In Canada, uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of screening has led to conflicting recommendations. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of one-time HCV screening. A state-transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact between a risk-based screening strategy (current-practice) and a one-time screening strategy on three different birth-cohorts. Cost and prevalence data were obtained from administrative data. Progression and utility data were based on recent systematic reviews. We used a provincial payer-perspective, life-time time-horizon and a 1.5% discount rate for the cost-effectiveness analysis, and used a 10-year time-horizon and no discounting for the budget-impact analysis. One-time screening strategy would cost more and provide more health benefits than the risk-based screening for all birth cohorts. For those born after 1964, the incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) of screening versus current-practice varied from $27,422/QALY to $42,191/QALY across different provinces.

A number of aspects of model validity have previously been described, but no systematic approach to assessing the validity of a model has been proposed. This study aimed to consolidate the different aspects of model validity into a step-by-step approach to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a decision-analytic model. Methods: A pre-defined set of steps were used to conduct the validation process of an exemplar early decision-analytic-model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programme [UK healthcare perspective; lifetime horizon; costs (£; 2021)]. Internal validation was assessed in terms of descriptive validity, technical validity and face validity. External validation was assessed in terms of operational validation, convergent validity (or corroboration) and predictive validity. Results: The results outline the findings of each step of internal and external validation of the early decision-analytic-model and present the validated model (called ‘MANC-RISK-SCREEN’).

Digital tools may help to reduce the economic burden for patients and payers by improving outcomes. The Propeller platform is a digital self-management tool that facilitates passive monitoring of inhaler medication utilization, potentially assisting the healthcare team to identify patients at risk of a COPD exacerbation who may require further intervention. This study estimated the budget impact of Propeller from commercial payer and Medicare fee-for-service payer perspectives. METHODS: An Excel-based model was used to estimate the budget impact of Propeller for COPD patients in commercial and Medicare population sizes of 5 million members. Data on prevalence, baseline healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and baseline use of rescue and controller inhaler medications with unit costs (adjusted to 2020 US dollars) were obtained from peer-reviewed literature. Data on reductions in HCRU during Propeller usage were based on direct evidence. Estimates for costs of remote monitoring were obtained from publicly available information. All patients were assumed to have insurance claims related to ongoing remote monitoring. RESULTS: The estimated number of annual eligible COPD patients for commercial and Medicare was 212,200 and 606,600, respectively.

Data on prevalence, baseline healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and baseline use of rescue and controller inhaler medications with unit costs (adjusted to 2020 US dollars) were obtained from peer-reviewed literature. Data on reductions in HCRU during Propeller usage were based on direct evidence. Estimates for costs of remote monitoring were obtained from publicly available information. All patients were assumed to have insurance claims related to ongoing remote monitoring. RESULTS: The estimated number of annual eligible COPD patients for commercial and Medicare was 212,200 and 606,600, respectively. Propeller decreased costs by an estimated $2,475 (commercial) and $915 (Medicare) per enrolled patient. The greatest increase in expenditure was for remote monitoring related expenses. After accounting for estimated reductions in hospitalizations, emergency department visits and short-acting beta-agonist use, total net savings were approximately $1.60 and $1.70 per-member per-month for commercial and Medicare payers, respectively.

However, the cost-effectiveness of these drugs in Iran is unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer resistant to castration in Iran. METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide and abiraterone from a social perspective over 10 years. The clinical inputs were obtained from the meta-analysis studies. The direct medical costs were obtained from the tariffs of the healthcare system, while the direct non-medical and indirect costs were collected from the patients. The data of utilities were derived from the literature. In addition, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainties. RESULTS: Compared with Abiraterone, enzalutamide was associated with a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6,260 per QALY gained. According to the one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER was most heavily influenced by the prices of enzalutamide and Abiraterone, non-medical costs, and indirect costs.

RESULTS: Compared with Abiraterone, enzalutamide was associated with a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6,260 per QALY gained. According to the one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER was most heavily influenced by the prices of enzalutamide and Abiraterone, non-medical costs, and indirect costs. Regardless of the variation, enzalutamide remained cost-effective. The budget impact analysis of enzalutamide in the health system during 5 years was estimated at $6,362,127.

However, the cost-effectiveness of these drugs in Iran is unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer resistant to castration in Iran. METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide and abiraterone from a social perspective over 10 years. The clinical inputs were obtained from the meta-analysis studies. The direct medical costs were obtained from the tariffs of the healthcare system, while the direct non-medical and indirect costs were collected from the patients. The data of utilities were derived from the literature. In addition, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainties.

AIM: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of LDX compared to MPH as the first-line treatment for ADHD. METHODS: A one-year cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted to compare the effects of LDX and MPH in reducing disease symptoms and patient costs and improving quality of life (QoL) from a social perspective. Clinical data were obtained using the EQ-5D questionnaire. In contrast, economic data were sourced from the official website of the Iranian Food and Drug Association (FDA), the national book of tariffs, and specific questionnaires designed to evaluate patients' direct and indirect costs. 197 patients were included in the study, including individuals who sought psychiatric evaluation at a hospital in Mashhad and those who obtained ADHD medications from governmental pharmacies. The cost-effectiveness of the study medicine was assessed using the decision tree method, and the results were presented as the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis (DSA) and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Additionally, a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) was conducted over five years, considering three different scenarios, to evaluate the financial implications of incorporating LDX into the national pharmaceutical system. RESULTS: The ICER for LDX therapy compared to MPH was estimated at USD 264.28 (with an incremental cost of USD 54.9, incremental effectiveness of 0.208, and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained of 0.765). The PSA indicated a 0.994% probability of LDX being cost-effective, considering a threshold of USD 2450 per QALY. Furthermore, the DSA revealed that the acquisition cost of LDX influenced the model's sensitivity. The BIA demonstrated that incorporating LDX into Iran's healthcare system would result in a financial burden of approximately $368,566 in the first year, representing an additional cost of $11,154 compared to the non-availability of this medicine and the use of previous medications. It is projected that by 2027, the financial burden of treating ADHD with LDX will reach approximately USD 443,879 over five years, amounting to an increase of $71,154 compared to the absence of this medicine.

11603808,Saweri OP,What does it cost to deliver antenatal care in Papua New Guinea? Results from a health system costing and budget impact analysis using cross-sectional data,BMJ Open,2024.0,"- OBJECTIVE: In Papua New Guinea (PNG), antenatal clinic attendance averaged 50% for one or more visits, and 30% for four visits in the last decade. In 2016, the WHO revised its focused antenatal care (ANC) model recommending eight rather than four visits. If implemented, this new model would require additional resources. This study estimated provider costs of ANC in PNG, including the expected cost of scaling up to universal ANC coverage as well as recommending eight visits. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional estimation of ANC costs collected from nine health facilities, which were part of a cluster randomised trial. Costs were estimated using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. The cost of the first and follow-up visits were estimated per woman, at the health facility level. Health system and scale-up costs of four visits were calculated by multiplying the aggregate cost of four visits by ANC utilisation rates. A budget impact analysis estimated the expected costs of delivering eight visits over 5 years. Univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted. Discounted costs are reported in local currency and 2019 international dollars using purchasing power parity data. RESULTS: The average cost of the first and follow-up visits were $17.66-$30.58 (K42.94-K74.34) in Madang and $11.26-$35.61 (K27.37-K86.56) in East New Britain. Four visits per woman cost $70.65-$122.33 (K171.76-K297.36) in Madang and $45.02-$142.45 (K109.50-K346.4) in East New Britain; and salaries represented the largest share of costs.

CONCLUSION: Costs varied with the number of clinicians, infrastructure and ANC coverage, suggesting scaling up requires increasing the financial investment in ANC services. These results provide a template to strengthen health systems by improving the quality of care.","Budget impact analysis of implementing a policy recommending pregnant women receive antenatal care eight times during pregnancy in 2019 international dollars. fANC, focused antenatal care.; Study setting; STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY; Background; Budget impact analysis","Which section does this sentence belong to: ""High rates of maternal, neonatal and child morbidity and mortality remain major public health challenges for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

In a real world setting, clinicians would benefit from biomarkers to monitor or predict response to AIT. METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive house dust mite (HDM) mono-sensitized rhinitic patients, treated with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) as per clinical practice, were enrolled. Multiple in vitro biomarkers such as basophil activation (BAT), IL-10 levels, and molecular allergen-specific IgE were performed during HDM SCIT, to monitor the effects of AIT and then correlated to in vivo scores (VAS, CMSS, RQLQ).

First, this model does not account for dose escalation of infliximab, which often happens in the treatment of IBD. However, given that infliximab SC is not weight dependent and does not allow dose escalation, not accounting for IV dose escalation results in a conservative figure when calculating the net budget impact. Where more patients require IV dose escalation, more savings will be incurred, as they would be receiving fixed-dose SC formulations. Also, patients remain on the same treatment for the entire time horizon of the model, with no discontinuation or switching or mortality. The model assumes that 100% of patients will require induction treatment in Year 1 and all patients continue maintenance therapy from Years 2 to 5, thus changes in proportion of treatment-naïve patients or switching patients might produce different results. However, there is insufficient information in the literature to ascertain more precise numbers of patients requiring induction treatment or switching population. In addition, patient share assumption generated by IQVIA data already reflects the induction and switching populations. Also, discontinuation rates and mortality would be similar in the “world with” and “world without” infliximab scenarios, resulting in zero net benefit. We decided that this approach is valid because if this model were tailored to show budget savings at the hospital or regional level, setting 100% patients to start from induction treatment would be more suitable than identifying proportion of patients who require induction treatment.""",Discussion

It poses a zoonotic public health risk to swine workers. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination for this high-risk group in China. A decision tree-Markov model was utilized to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two hepatitis E vaccination strategies, without or following screening, for swine workers aged 16-60 in China from societal perspectives, compared to no vaccination. We calculated HEV-related cases and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of GDP per capita. A sensitivity analysis was conducted. Additionally, we stimulated the scenarios of fully receiving 3-dose schedule, partially receiving 3-dose schedule, and fully receiving 2-dose schedule.

10259044,Ma Y,Exploration of an alternative reconstructed individual patient data-based approach for budget impact analysis of anticancer drugs,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2023.0,"- BACKGROUND: The duration of treatment (DOT) of the initial intervention and subsequent treatment is the key to determining the accuracy of anticancer-drug budget impact analysis (BIA) calculations. However, existing studies only use simple assumptions as a proxy for DOT, resulting in a high degree of bias. OBJECTIVES: To enhance the accuracy and reliability of anticancer-drug BIA and solve the problem regarding DOT, we propose an alternative individual patient data (IPD)-based approach that reconstructs IPD from the published Kaplan Meier survival curves to estimate DOT. METHODS: We developed a four-step methodological framework for this new approach, taking the use of pembrolizumab in treating microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) advanced colorectal cancer as an example: (1) reconstructing the IPD; (2) calculating the total DOT of the initial intervention and subsequent treatment for each patient; (3) assigning a randomized time and DOT; and (4) multiple replacement sampling and calculation of the mean value.

The sum of the costs of all patients can then be calculated, which is the total cost of the target population considered in the BIA. Researchers can also consider using the second calculation method when the target population is small. It should be noted that while the amount of anticancer drugs used is primarily determined by the DOT, other factors, including patient adherence, physician compliance with guidelines, and patient perception of risk, may also impact their amount in treatments of different cancers.

Budget impact analysis (BIA) assists managers in promoting more sustainable health systems; however, it is unclear whether BIAs underestimate or overestimate the estimates derived from real-world data. This study aimed to compare the estimated BIA values of risperidone use and the monitoring of adverse events in ASD using theoretical and real data. METHODS: Analyses were conducted based on the clinical protocol and the Brazilian therapeutic guidelines for ASD. The perspective adopted was that of the Unified Health System (SUS), considering a time horizon of 5 years. Three possible scenarios were considered based on the maximum daily dose of risperidone.

Budget impact analysis (BIA) assists managers in promoting more sustainable health systems; however, it is unclear whether BIAs underestimate or overestimate the estimates derived from real-world data. This study aimed to compare the estimated BIA values of risperidone use and the monitoring of adverse events in ASD using theoretical and real data. METHODS: Analyses were conducted based on the clinical protocol and the Brazilian therapeutic guidelines for ASD. The perspective adopted was that of the Unified Health System (SUS), considering a time horizon of 5 years. Three possible scenarios were considered based on the maximum daily dose of risperidone. Expenses related to the acquisition of risperidone and the monitoring of adverse events were taken into account using health databases in Brazil. For the calculation based on theoretical data, the prevalence of ASD was estimated using information from the scientific literature and the Brazilian demographic census. The model calculated from real data was obtained by analyzing the linear trend of the number of users assisted in the SUS from 2017 to 2021. RESULTS: The population estimated by the theoretical model compared with the model calculated from the real data was higher. Likewise, the 5-year budgetary impact of the theoretical model versus the model calculated from the real data was higher, with statistical significance in all scenarios (p < 0.001). In the real data model, the most economically advantageous scenarios were Scenario 1 for children (International dollars [I$] 7,630,040.73) and Scenario 3 for adults (I$60,329,288.17). Estimated expenditures for monitoring adverse events ranged from 17 to 74% in children and from 50% to 63% in adults.

Objective: We evaluated the economic impact of long-acting injections of paliperidone palmitate (PP) vs daily oral antipsychotics to treat chronic schizophrenia from a societal perspective over a 2-year period. Methods: A static budget impact model was developed to compare PP with daily oral antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our study included treatments used during relapse and hospitalization, validated by an expert panel. The clinical parameters were extracted from the PRIDE trial. Direct medical costs and indirect costs were measured. The unit cost of drug acquisition for all medications was extracted from the public sector. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The target population in our model was estimated to be 142 incident patients. In the first year, the total drug costs in Egyptian pounds (EGP) for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5.6 million, respectively. In the second year, the total drug costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5 million, respectively. The total costs for PP (£11.6 million) over 2 years were less than those of oral antipsychotics without PP (£12.7 million). PP produced an estimated budget savings of £1 046 561 (budget savings per patient per year, £3667). In addition, PP resulted in the avoidance of 18 hospitalizations per year compared with the without-PP arm. Sensitivity analyses showed that the percent of hospitalizations for both oral antipsychotics and PP had the greatest impact on the results.

In the first year, the total drug costs in Egyptian pounds (EGP) for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5.6 million, respectively. In the second year, the total drug costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5 million, respectively. The total costs for PP (£11.6 million) over 2 years were less than those of oral antipsychotics without PP (£12.7 million). PP produced an estimated budget savings of £1 046 561 (budget savings per patient per year, £3667). In addition, PP resulted in the avoidance of 18 hospitalizations per year compared with the without-PP arm.

This study aims to determine the impact on healthcare costs of implementing an enhanced short-stay model of care (ESS-MOC) for arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted for the years 2023-2030 in the setting of Australian publicly and privately funded hospitals performing hip or knee arthroplasty. The model considered population-based future arthroplasty projections, published data on healthcare costs and resource utilisation, and aggregate health insurer claims data related to minor complexity elective hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. The ESS-MOC assigned a conservative hypothesized 30% of eligible patients to an enhanced recovery from surgery (ERAS) pathway which comprised a shortened acute ward stay (average 2 days versus 4 days with current care) and outpatient rehabilitation. The primary outcome was total healthcare cost savings post-ESS-MOC implementation, stratified by joint (knee/hip) and healthcare sector (public/private). Return on investment (ROI) ratio, measuring the return for each dollar invested in implementation, and hospital bed days utilized, were also estimated. Costs are presented in Australian dollars (AUD), at 2023 prices. RESULTS: Estimated cost savings for 2023-2030 from implementing the ESS-MOC pathway were AUD641 million (95% CI: AUD99 million to AUD1250 million), corresponding to a ROI ratio of AUD8.88 (AUD1.3 to AUD17.9). Total implementation costs for the ESS-MOC were estimated at AUD38 million and AUD34 million for the private and public sectors, respectively. Savings would be 8-fold higher in the private sector (AUD571 million vs. AUD70 million in the public sector), primarily attributable to the > 80,000 rehabilitation bed days saved annually in this sector. For the period 2023-2030, an estimated 337,000 (261,000 to 412,000) acute bed days could be saved (private sector 262,000 [200,000 to 324,000]; public sector 74,000 [57,000 to 92,000]).

This study aims to determine the impact on healthcare costs of implementing an enhanced short-stay model of care (ESS-MOC) for arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted for the years 2023-2030 in the setting of Australian publicly and privately funded hospitals performing hip or knee arthroplasty. The model considered population-based future arthroplasty projections, published data on healthcare costs and resource utilisation, and aggregate health insurer claims data related to minor complexity elective hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. The ESS-MOC assigned a conservative hypothesized 30% of eligible patients to an enhanced recovery from surgery (ERAS) pathway which comprised a shortened acute ward stay (average 2 days versus 4 days with current care) and outpatient rehabilitation. The primary outcome was total healthcare cost savings post-ESS-MOC implementation, stratified by joint (knee/hip) and healthcare sector (public/private).

Despite the burden, CVD preventive services receive low government and donor budgets, which has led to poor CVD outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effective analysis and a budget impact analysis on CVD prevention strategies recommended by the WHO. A Markov model was used to analyse the cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from healthcare provider and societal perspectives. We calculated transition probabilities from WHO CVD risk data and obtained treatment effects and costs from secondary sources. Subgroup analysis was performed on different sex and age groups. We framed the budget impact analysis from a healthcare provider perspective to assess the affordability of providing CVD preventive care. FINDINGS: The most cost-effective strategy from the healthcare provider perspective varied. The combination of screening, primary prevention, and secondary prevention (Sc-PP-SP) (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: US$1574/QALY) is most cost-effective at the three times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita threshold, while at one time the GDP per capita threshold, secondary prevention is the most cost-effective strategy (ICER: US$160/QALY).

Myanmar’s WHO PEN project started in two townships in 2012 and expanded to 20 townships in 2017. Between May 2017 and December 2018, the project screened a total of 152,446 individuals for NCD risk factors, which is much lower than the estimated eligible population.

11022086,Win ZM,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of screening and preventive interventions for cardiovascular disease in Myanmar: an economic modelling study,Lancet Reg Health Southeast Asia,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality in Myanmar. Despite the burden, CVD preventive services receive low government and donor budgets, which has led to poor CVD outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effective analysis and a budget impact analysis on CVD prevention strategies recommended by the WHO. A Markov model was used to analyse the cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from healthcare provider and societal perspectives. We calculated transition probabilities from WHO CVD risk data and obtained treatment effects and costs from secondary sources. Subgroup analysis was performed on different sex and age groups. We framed the budget impact analysis from a healthcare provider perspective to assess the affordability of providing CVD preventive care. FINDINGS: The most cost-effective strategy from the healthcare provider perspective varied. The combination of screening, primary prevention, and secondary prevention (Sc-PP-SP) (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: US$1574/QALY) is most cost-effective at the three times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita threshold, while at one time the GDP per capita threshold, secondary prevention is the most cost-effective strategy (ICER: US$160/QALY). Sc-PP-SP is the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective (ICER: US$647/QALY). Among age groups, intervention at age 45 years appeared to be the most cost-effective option for both men and women. The budget impact revealed the Sc-PP-SP would avert 55,000 acute CVD events and 28,000 CVD-related deaths with a cost of US$157 million for the first year of CVD preventive care. INTERPRETATION: A combination of screening, primary prevention, and secondary prevention is cost-effective to reduce CVD-related deaths in Myanmar. This study provides evidence for the government and development partners to increase investment in and support for CVD prevention. These findings not only provide a basis for efficient resource allocation but also underscore the importance of adopting a total cardiovascular risk approach to CVD prevention, in alignment with global health goals.

METHODS: A BIA model was used to analyse over a 5-year time horizon the change in the health system's budget following the adoption of olaparib as maintenance therapy in BRCAm patients with PSROC. The BIA for each year was estimated by comparing the cost difference between the current scenario (treatment with bevacizumab) and the new scenario (the addition of olaparib) for a third-party payer. The BIA is estimated at the national health system level, and by healthcare sectors in Argentina (public sector, social security and private sector). International and national epidemiological data were used to determine the target patient population. Clinical efficacy, safety outcomes and duration of treatments were obtained from the pivotal clinical study report. Relevant direct medical costs were obtained from public data in Argentina and expert consultation. All the costs are reported in US dollars as of October 2022 ($1 = 152.59 Argentine pesos). A scenario analysis assessed the full coverage of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test in Argentina. In addition, one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the model robustness. RESULTS: For a third-party payer with a cohort of 1,000,000 women covered, the estimated target population was 2 individuals in year 1 and 6 individuals in year 5. The incorporation of olaparib, with a wholesale price per pack of $3176.32, was associated with a weighted average of the budget impact per member per month (PMPM) of $0.062 for the national health system, being above the estimated health system budget impact threshold ($0.0153). By healthcare sector, the results of budget impact PMPM for year 5 ranged between $0.08 (public sector) and $0.114 (private sector). For all perspectives, the variables that most influenced the budget impact was the incidence of ovarian cancer, the drug acquisition cost and the treatment duration.

METHODS: A BIA model was used to analyse over a 5-year time horizon the change in the health system's budget following the adoption of olaparib as maintenance therapy in BRCAm patients with PSROC. The BIA for each year was estimated by comparing the cost difference between the current scenario (treatment with bevacizumab) and the new scenario (the addition of olaparib) for a third-party payer. The BIA is estimated at the national health system level, and by healthcare sectors in Argentina (public sector, social security and private sector).

METHODS: A 5-year horizon budget impact model was developed to determine the budget impact of reimbursing luspatercept for the management of β-thalassaemia major in Cyprus. Two treatment discontinuation scenarios were elaborated. In the first scenario, luspatercept is reimbursed complementary to best supportive care, and a dropout rate of 40% is assumed based on published real-world data, while for the second scenario a dropout rate of 25%, is assumed as per the clinical trial data.

With an ageing population and a rising number of single-person households, there is a growing need for new approaches that enable individuals to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. Smart HECSs represent one promising solution in providing improved care for this population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smart HECSs in Germany. While research on the underlying technologies of sensor-based fall detection is extensive, evidence from clinical trials on smart HECSs’ impact on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness remains scarce. This study aims to address this gap by generating evidence on whether these smart systems are superior compared with standard HECSs or no HECSs in reducing the hospital length of stay after emergency admission in the older population at risk of falling.""",Discussion

If an emergency occurs within the home environment of an older person living alone, the initiation of emergency care can be delayed, leading to even worse outcomes for this population. Smart home emergency call systems (HECSs) can detect falls and automatically trigger an emergency alarm, potentially reducing time to emergency care and improving outcomes. The INES (Intelligentes NotfallErkennungsSystem-smart emergency detection system) study is a prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in three German federal states that aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a smart HECS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Following a telephone interview, individuals aged 70 years or older, living alone, at risk of falling and willing to participate are included in the study. Participants are assigned to one of two groups depending on their previous use of a HECS. Based on the sample size calculation, the study aims to recruit n=498 participants already using a standard HECS (group A) and n=1378 participants who have not used a HECS before (group B). Within both groups, participants are randomised into the intervention arm (IA) and control arm (CA). The IA receives a smart HECS during the 21-month follow-up period. In addition to a standard HECS with a base station and a wearable radio transmitter, the smart HECS includes sensors that can detect falls and automatically trigger an alarm. The primary outcome assessed will be the days spent in the hospital after an emergency admission. Secondary outcomes include the utilisation of healthcare services and their total costs, progression of care dependency, fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and well-being (ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people).

These IM practices include acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback, massage, mindfulness, or any combination of these modalities. The current article﻿ developed a budget impact model to estimate the institutional costs of implementing these practices among adolescents. METHODS: A decision tree was used to estimate the reduction in hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) use based on a previously published retrospective analysis of children receiving IM practices comparing utilization rates 1-year pre-implementation and post-implementation of IM services (Figure 1). Costs associated with implementing each modality were based on hourly compensation rates for licensed professionals administering each service and equipment associated with delivery (eg, acupuncture needles, biofeedback equipment, and sensors). The cost of each hospitalization and ED visit was derived from the literature. In addition, cost savings were estimated based on government-contracted and commercial-contracted reimbursement rates for each service. RESULTS: Cost savings were approximated to range from $1344 to $3439 per patient, with even greater cost savings of up to $6000 and $4132 when accounting for governmental and commercial payer reimbursement, respectively.

Clinical studies were utilized to extract data on drug efficacy and patients' utility, while cost data were collected from Greek sources. The results of the study showed that aboBoNT-A plus BSC was a cost-effective treatment option for both upper and lower limb spasticity in adult patients compared to BSC. Additionally, introducing aboBoNT-A into the Greek healthcare system resulted in cost savings in pharmaceutical spending over a 5-year period. The findings suggest that incorporating aboBoNT-A into the Greek healthcare system could improve patient access to treatment and healthcare resource efficiency, as it is a more economical option compared to onaBoNT-A.",2.

The model begins with a population of patients that match the baseline characteristics of patients in the aboBoNT-A upper limb spasticity clinical trial program in terms of age, sex, and DAS level distribution.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the affordability and budget impact, in the United Kingdom, of introducing cangrelor within the licenced OHCA population. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of introducing cangrelor to hospitals over 5 years. Efficacy (thrombotic events) and safety (bleeding events) data were based on clinical trials, cost data (2021/22 GBP), literature, NHS reference costs and British National Formulary data. Comparators were glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and aspirin in combination with heparin, reflecting current treatments used in UK centres for the target population. Cangrelor uptake was estimated as 50% in Year 1, 75% in Year 2, and 100% in Years 3-5. The OHCA population was estimated from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society National Audit 2021/22. RESULTS: Over 5 years, cangrelor leads to modelled cost savings of £2,709,853 (-9.84%), varying from £322,218 in Year 1 (-5.85%) to £636,150 (-11.55%) in Year 5).

11729056,Chamani AT,Budget Impact Analysis of Implementing Antenatal Care Recommendations for Positive Pregnancy Outcomes at Public Primary Facilities in Tanzania,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: Tanzania recently changed its antenatal care (ANC) guidelines to reduce perinatal mortality and improve the experience of pregnancy care. The new guideline recommends increasing the number of ANC visits from four to eight and introducing one routine ultrasound scan, among other recommendations. We estimated the budget impact of implementing the new guideline compared to the previous focused ANC guideline at public dispensaries and health centers. METHOD: In a dynamic Markov model, we prospectively followed annual cohorts of between 2.3 and 2.6 million pregnant women who will be attending ANC at dispensaries and health centers for 5 years. We allowed a population of pregnant women into the model every year and women exit the model at delivery. We calculated the cost of medicines, medical supplies, and laboratory supplies required to produce services from a public health system perspective. Our model neither estimated condition-related costs nor health effects. The budget impact was calculated as the difference in the estimated costs between the two guidelines. We conducted scenario analyses to explore attending more visits and different assumptions to calculate the target population. RESULTS: We estimated that implementing the new ANC guideline would have a cumulative budget impact of around US$154 million over 5 years. The budget required will increase from US$137 million under the focused ANC guideline to US$291 million under the new guideline. Laboratory supplies will consume 47% of the estimated budget under the new guideline. We expect the annual budget impact to be US$38 million in the first year of implementation and US$32 million in the fifth year. We assumed that by the fifth year, 82% of all pregnant women would have had four or more visits. The budget impact would increase to US$214 million, with the proportion of pregnant women attending four or more ANC visits reaching 90% within 5 years.

Our model neither estimated condition-related costs nor health effects. The budget impact was calculated as the difference in the estimated costs between the two guidelines. We conducted scenario analyses to explore attending more visits and different assumptions to calculate the target population. RESULTS: We estimated that implementing the new ANC guideline would have a cumulative budget impact of around US$154 million over 5 years. The budget required will increase from US$137 million under the focused ANC guideline to US$291 million under the new guideline.

In scenario analysis, patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) treated with 60 units or less of daily insulin (insulin cohort) or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only (OAD cohort) were intensified to iGlarLixi/rapid-acting insulin (RAI)/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or iGlarLixi/iGlar/GLP-1RA, respectively. Model inputs from real-world data (RWD) included baseline market shares, proportion of patients intensifying to respective treatments, and dosing inputs; unit costs were obtained from published literature.

10597971,Ken-Opurum J,Budget Impact Analysis of Intensification with iGlarLixi Compared to Alternative Treatment Strategies Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetes Ther,2023.0,"- INTRODUCTION: The clinical benefits of treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with fixed-ratio combination of insulin iGlar (iGlar) plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) were demonstrated in clinical trials and real-world evidence studies; however, its cost impact to healthcare payers is unknown. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed from a United States (US) payer's perspective for a hypothetical healthcare plan of 1 million people over a 1-year time horizon. In scenario analysis, patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) treated with 60 units or less of daily insulin (insulin cohort) or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only (OAD cohort) were intensified to iGlarLixi/rapid-acting insulin (RAI)/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or iGlarLixi/iGlar/GLP-1RA, respectively. Model inputs from real-world data (RWD) included baseline market shares, proportion of patients intensifying to respective treatments, and dosing inputs; unit costs were obtained from published literature. One-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of individual parameters. RESULTS: Intensification with iGlarLixi resulted in the lowest incremental per member per month (PMPM) budget impact compared to other intensifying drugs (iGlar, RAI, and GLP-1RA). In the insulin cohort, the incremental PMPM cost for intensification with iGlarLixi ($0.03) was the lowest among intensifying drugs; GLP-1RA ($72.20) and RAI ($4.81). Similarly, the incremental PMPM cost for intensification with iGlarLixi was the lowest ($1.25) in the OAD cohort among intensifying drugs; GLP-1RA ($321.65) and iGlar ($114.82). In scenario analyses, when equal market intensification shares for iGlarLixi and GLP-1RA were explored, the incremental PMPM cost for iGlarLixi ($0.03) remained lower than GLP-1RA ($2.28) and RAI ($10.44) in the insulin cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Intensification with iGlarLixi was associated with lower costs compared to other treatment intensifications, as well as overall budget reductions compared to pre-intensification when considering cost savings attributable to reduction in HbA1c; therefore, its inclusion for the treatment of T2DM would represent a budget saving.",Acknowledgements; Conclusions; Ethical Approval; Discussion; Conflict of Interest,"Which section does this sentence belong to: ""The strengths of this study included analysis of two cohorts of patients identified in RWD who would be clinically eligible to intensify to respective treatment options, budget impact analysis pertaining to intensification strategies implemented in the Lixilan-L and -O trials, selection of model inputs from a variety of sources including administrative claims, the literature, data on file, and clinical opinion, and use of a contemporary cohort of patients whose costs were inflated to the most up to date values at the time of analysis. However, several limitations remain. As we followed protocol design of the Lixilan-L and -O clinical trials, any treatments not included therein were likewise excluded from the model. Although HbA1c is a reliable measure of chronic glycemia, the cost savings associated with HbA1c were fixed in the model regardless of the patient’s current HbA1c value. Moreover, the current model did not consider the safety outcomes associated with treatment. The optimal management of T2DM should consider not only the efficacy of antidiabetic drugs in lowering blood sugar levels but also cardiovascular safety and other long-term diabetes complications [""",Discussion

Injuries impose a significant financial burden on individual households, leading to substantial out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPE) causing severe financial distress for the families of the victims. This study explores the profile and economic ramifications of such injuries, emphasizing the urgent need for intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed methods study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore, Karnataka, analyses data from 148 occupational injury cases over 6 months. Ethical approval was obtained, and data were collected from hospital records and direct patient inquiries. Demographics, injury characteristics, root causes, and outcomes were analyzed. The economic burden, catastrophic health expenditure, awareness, and utilization of social security schemes (SSS) were assessed. RESULTS: A predominant demographic vulnerability exists among workers under 25 years old, especially in high-risk sectors. Traumatic injuries, primarily due to employee negligence, are prevalent, with extremity injuries and ocular injuries being common. While 68.9% of participants claimed access to personal protective equipment (PPE) at their work sites, only 51.4% reported actual usage of PPE.

11574529,van Well EB,The value of reducing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in the treatment of degenerative meniscus tears: a budget impact analysis,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2023.0,"- AIMS: Numerous studies have shown that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is not (cost-) effective in patients with symptoms attributed to a degenerative meniscus tear. We aimed to assess the budget impact of reducing APM in routine clinical practice in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to simulate patients recently diagnosed with a degenerative meniscus tear. Three strategies were compared: ""current guideline"" (i.e., postpone surgery to at least 3 months after diagnosis), ""APM at any time"" (i.e., APM available directly after diagnosis), and ""nonsurgical"" (i.e., APM no longer performed). Total societal costs over 5 years were calculated to determine the budget impact. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address uncertainty. RESULTS: The average cost per patient over 5 years were EUR 5,077, EUR 4,577, and EUR 4,218, for the ""APM at any time,"" ""current guideline,"" and ""nonsurgical"" strategy, respectively. Removing APM from the treatment mix (i.e., 30,000 patients per year) in the Netherlands, resulted in a reduction in health care expenditures of EUR 54 million (95 percent confidence interval [CI] EUR 38 million-EUR 70 million) compared to the ""current guideline strategy"" and EUR 129 million (95 percent CI EUR 102 million-EUR 156 million) compared to the ""APM at any time"" strategy. Sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty did not alter our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial costs can be saved when APM is no longer performed to treat symptoms attributed to degenerative meniscus tears in the Netherlands. It is therefore recommended to further reduce the use of APM to treat degenerative meniscus tears.",Author contributions; Key words; Strengths and limitations; Introduction; One-way sensitivity analysis,"Which section does this sentence belong to: ""Despite these guidelines, the usage of APM to treat degenerative meniscus tears remains high.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cost minimization analysis (CMA) adopted a Markov model with three different states, and it is based on the results of REFINE study and its post-hoc analysis, which evaluated and demonstrated the non-inferiority of natalizumab SC vs IV formulation. The economic inputs came mainly from EASIER study, that estimated the administration time, resource consumption, and costs of natalizumab SC vs IV. A lifetime horizon was considered. Budget impact analysis (BIA) was conducted with a cost calculator approach and compared a base scenario (without SC natalizumab) with an alternative scenario (with SC natalizumab). The inputs were shared with the CMA and a 3-year time horizon was considered. A progressive increase in the number of patients treated with natalizumab SC was estimated from the 1st to the 2nd to the 3rd year after reimbursement in Italy.

This mixed methods study determines the costs and priorities of deploying Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs (REP) to implement the Michigan Model for Health™, a universal school-based prevention intervention, from key shareholder perspectives. METHODS: Our study included teachers in 8 high schools across 3 Michigan counties as part of a pilot cluster randomized trial. We used activity-based costing, mapping key Enhanced REP activities across implementation phases. We included multiple perspectives, including state agencies, regional education service agencies, lead organization, and implementers. We also conducted a budget impact analysis (BIA, assessing the potential financial impact of adopting Enhanced REP) and a scenario analysis to estimate replication and account for cost variability. We used an experimental embedded mixed methods approach, conducting semi-structured interviews and collecting field notes during the trial to expand and explain the cost data and the implications of costs across relevant perspectives. RESULTS: Based on trial results, we estimate costs for deploying Enhanced REP are $11,903/school, with an estimated range between $8263/school and $15,201/school.

We used an experimental embedded mixed methods approach, conducting semi-structured interviews and collecting field notes during the trial to expand and explain the cost data and the implications of costs across relevant perspectives. RESULTS: Based on trial results, we estimate costs for deploying Enhanced REP are $11,903/school, with an estimated range between $8263/school and $15,201/school. We estimate that adding four additional schools, consistent with the pilot, would cost $8659/school. Qualitative results indicated misalignment in school and teacher priorities in some cases.

We estimate only the budget impact using the same number of schools in the pilot test. Considering other schools would require speculation on the economies (or diseconomies) of scale of the implementation. We also calculated budget impacts from each shareholder’s perspective when estimating the BIA. The university tasks were transferred to the health coordinators and state agency employees, with schools bearing no additional cost in replication. This determination was based on input from the state agency and RESA partners on what types of costs they typically incur related to implementation, although it may vary. Consistent with the current partnership structure, University employees would serve only in minor consultation roles with an estimated cost of $343.53. We anticipated that school districts would have the most significant increase in costs and time commitment. We estimated a total cost of $17,483 for the school districts, an increase of $8892 or roughly doubling the cost. State agency partners funded all the fixed costs in implementation. Thus, we estimated a decrease in their share of the overall cost in the budget impact analysis. Simultaneously, the state agency would likely contribute more labor efforts to repeated implementation. For the state agency partners, we estimated a decrease in fixed costs of $14,385 and an increase in variable labor costs of $3107, resulting in a net cost reduction of $11,278.""",Budget impact analysis

MATERIALS AND METHOD: A randomized crossover study enrolled 36 fully edentulous patients, in whom six maxillary implants were placed together with two mandibular implants, if not already present. At the start of the study, a set of C‐IODs and 3D‐IODs was fabricated for each patient. All patients wore each IOD‐type for 1 year: first the 3D‐IOD and the second year a C‐IOD, or vice versa. At all three‐time points patients general QoL was assessed using the EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaire as well as the SF‐36 from which the SF‐6D was obtained, to research the anticipation of no significant difference.

Treatments for this condition have undergone major developments in recent decades; however, the treatment for RA remains a challenge for medicine. In this sense, the Coronary Sinus Reducer System (CSRS) stands as the last line of therapy for ineligible patients for revascularization with reversible ischemia. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the potential burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and measure the health effects in terms of both quantity (life years) and quality-of-life aspects related to the reducer. METHODS: Two different economic evaluation models were developed as part of the analysis. The budget impact was developed to estimate the potential burden on the NHS from incremental uptake of the use of the reducer in the target population. The utility cost analysis compares and evaluates the quality of life and health resource use and costs between the two alternatives, based on the research of Gallone et al. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to characterize the uncertainty around the parameters of the model. RESULTS: In the budget impact analysis (BIA), the reducer is shown to be more expensive in the first 2 years of the model, due to the gradual uptake in the market and the cost of the device. Starting from the third year, assuming maintenance of effectiveness, there are savings in terms of resource absorption in direct healthcare costs arising from hospitalizations, emergency department accesses, coronarography, and visits avoided. CONCLUSION: The BIA and cost-effectiveness model show that the reducer device, despite an increase in resources absorbed in the first years of implementation and use, has the potential to result in increased quality of life in patients with RA.

10982321,Fortunato A,A budget impact model and a cost–utility analysis of reducer device (Neovasc) in patients with refractory angina,Front Cardiovasc Med,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: Refractory angina (RA) is a chronic condition characterized by the presence of debilitating angina symptoms due to established reversible ischemia in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Treatments for this condition have undergone major developments in recent decades; however, the treatment for RA remains a challenge for medicine. In this sense, the Coronary Sinus Reducer System (CSRS) stands as the last line of therapy for ineligible patients for revascularization with reversible ischemia. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the potential burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and measure the health effects in terms of both quantity (life years) and quality-of-life aspects related to the reducer. METHODS: Two different economic evaluation models were developed as part of the analysis. The budget impact was developed to estimate the potential burden on the NHS from incremental uptake of the use of the reducer in the target population. The utility cost analysis compares and evaluates the quality of life and health resource use and costs between the two alternatives, based on the research of Gallone et al. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to characterize the uncertainty around the parameters of the model.

DESIGN: Using a Markov model, adopting a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon with a 3% annual discount rate, the cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare BoNT-A combined with standard of care (SoC) with SoC alone. Costs, utilities, transitional probabilities and treatment efficacy were derived from 5-year retrospective data from tertiary hospitals and meta-analysis. Uncertainty analyses were performed. SETTING: Tertiary hospitals in Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: Cohort of post-stroke patients aged 55 years with UL or LL spasticity and a Modified Ashworth Scale score ≥1+. INTERVENTIONS: BoNT-A (abobotulinumtoxinA: aboBoNT-A, onabotulinumtoxinA: onaBoNT-A or prabotulinumtoxinA: praBoNT-A) combined with SoC versus SoC alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of 160 000 THB (US$4468) per QALY gained. RESULTS: The combination of aboBoNT-A and SoC yielded the highest QALYs gained (0.013 for UL and 0.11 for LL), followed by onaBoNT-A and SoC and praBoNT-A and SoC. The additional costs for treating UL and LL cases were highest for onaBoNT-A US$75 and US$95, respectively, followed by aboBoNT-A and praBoNT-A. ICER values for treating UL with aboBoNT-A, onaBoNT-A and praBoNT-A ranged from US$4669 to US$7541 per QALY.

The cost-effectiveness of various anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) was assessed to supplement the NICE guideline for treating PDR. METHODS: A Markov model including eight levels of visual acuity (ranged between >85 and ≤25 letters) was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab, aflibercept and bevacizumab with PRP (alone or in combination). Clinical inputs in the model were based on literature, while a published network meta-analysis (NMA) informed visual outcomes. Costs were estimated from a UK NHS perspective. RESULTS: Assuming initial treatment effects from the NMA continued to be applied for the remainder of lifetime, the probabilistic analysis resulted in bevacizumab plus PRP producing the highest net monetary benefit (NMB [95% CI]) of £221,374 [£203,941-£238,388] at £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. However, assuming initial treatment effects stabilised over time resulted in PRP alone producing the highest NMB of £223,416 [£209,318-£236,866].

Second, the simplifying conceptualization of the transition of patients between the stages of active treatment and active post-treatment may not reflect the usual care standards for the disease, given that in medical practice it could continue administering the therapy with which an adequate response was achieved during the active treatment period, beyond the budget period under analysis. Third, there is still no evidence of the cost-effectiveness of VEN at the local level, so the decision-making regarding the introduction of VEN would be limited to the budget impact results provided by this study.

At our academic center, we have adopted a strategy of early surgery (<12 hours) and aimed to assess its impact on patients undergoing MIPS from an economic standpoint. This study introduces an innovative preoperative protocol to reduce costs and improve efficiency in the healthcare setting for patients undergoing ICH evacuation. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent MIPS for spontaneous ICH evacuation between 2014 and 2017. The patients were stratified into two groups: expedited versus control and early versus late operation. The expedited protocol involved using either computed tomography angiography (CTA) or a stereotactic head CT for guidance during the operation.  Results Nine patients were included in the expedited protocol group, where they were taken from the emergency department (ED) for CT and CTA, followed by a surgical decision, and then directly to the operating room (OR) from the imaging center. Nine patients were included in the control group, where they were taken from the ED for CT and CTA and returned to the ED, followed by a surgical decision, then to the imaging center for a stereotactic CTH for intraoperative navigation, and then to the OR.

At our academic center, we have adopted a strategy of early surgery (<12 hours) and aimed to assess its impact on patients undergoing MIPS from an economic standpoint. This study introduces an innovative preoperative protocol to reduce costs and improve efficiency in the healthcare setting for patients undergoing ICH evacuation. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent MIPS for spontaneous ICH evacuation between 2014 and 2017. The patients were stratified into two groups: expedited versus control and early versus late operation. The expedited protocol involved using either computed tomography angiography (CTA) or a stereotactic head CT for guidance during the operation.  Results Nine patients were included in the expedited protocol group, where they were taken from the emergency department (ED) for CT and CTA, followed by a surgical decision, and then directly to the operating room (OR) from the imaging center. Nine patients were included in the control group, where they were taken from the ED for CT and CTA and returned to the ED, followed by a surgical decision, then to the imaging center for a stereotactic CTH for intraoperative navigation, and then to the OR. Additionally, eleven patients were in the early operation group, and seven were in the late operation group. The mean time from ED admission to surgery was 8.2 hours for the early operation group and 62.2 hours for the late operation group (p = 0.10). The control group had 38 preoperative scans, while the expedited group had 17. The mean preoperative imaging cost decreased from $2,039 in the control to $1,003 in the expedited group (p = 0.004). Similarly, the mean preoperative imaging cost was $2,061 for the late operation group and $1,162 for the early operation group, respectively (p = 0.02). There was a 15% decrease in the postoperative hospital stay cost per patient (p > 0.05). Conclusion Patients undergoing an expedited preoperative protocol and early surgery experienced a statistically significant reduction in preoperative costs and a shorter time between ED admission and surgery.

Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training offers a standardized approach to trauma care, yet its impact in India remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ATLS training in reducing preventable trauma-related deaths and improving clinical decision-making at a tertiary care center in Bihar, India. Methods This mixed-methods cohort study was conducted from October 2021 to December 2024 and included 200 trauma patients aged ≥18 years. Patients were divided into two groups: pre-ATLS (retrospective; October 2021 to July 2024) and post-ATLS (prospective; August 2024 to December 2024). Mortality rates, trauma management errors, and survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, chi-square tests, logistic regression models, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Additionally, structured interviews with healthcare providers supplemented the quantitative findings. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software, Version 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with significance set at p < 0.05. Results ATLS training significantly reduced preventable deaths (from 30% to 15%) and potentially preventable deaths (from 40% to 25%). Trauma management errors, including delayed diagnoses and protocol deviations, also decreased post-training. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved survival, while Cox regression identified ATLS training as an independent predictor of survival (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.85, p = 0.003).

In Spain, estimates suggest that the direct healthcare costs of CKD will increase by 13.8% from 2022, which is why the cost of kidney replacement treatment (KRT) programs efficiency and sustainability is under constant analysis. Our analysis aimed to estimate the cost associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to hemodialysis (HD) from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective and to evaluate the budgetary impact of an increase in the use of PD in our healthcare system environment. METHODS: The number of patients eligible for KRT was calculated based on the total Spanish population and the incidence and prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients receiving each modality, type of dialysis, and location of dialysis were estimated. The annual costs of each dialysis modality were calculated and included the cost of dialysis sessions and additional costs (including the cost of peritoneal and vascular access, hospitalisation costs due to potential complications of dialysis, cost of health care personnel, and cost of health care transport used by patients). Population data and costs (€, 2024) were obtained from the Spanish databases and a nephrologist validated the assumptions. Budget impact analysis assessed the incremental budget impact between the current scenario and the alternative scenario, where 30% of incident patients on scheduled HD would receive PD. RESULTS: We estimated that in Spain, there are 27,281 prevalent dialysis patients (3,141 receiving PD and 24,140 receiving HD/HDF) and 6,052 incident dialysis patients (1,173 receiving PD and 4,879 HD/HDF).

12032717,Barbado G,Budgetary impact of increasing use of peritoneal dialysis over haemodialysis in Spain,Health Econ Rev,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a significant public health concern, due to its high prevalence and incidence, as well as its substantial socio-economic costs. In Spain, estimates suggest that the direct healthcare costs of CKD will increase by 13.8% from 2022, which is why the cost of kidney replacement treatment (KRT) programs efficiency and sustainability is under constant analysis. Our analysis aimed to estimate the cost associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to hemodialysis (HD) from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective and to evaluate the budgetary impact of an increase in the use of PD in our healthcare system environment. METHODS: The number of patients eligible for KRT was calculated based on the total Spanish population and the incidence and prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients receiving each modality, type of dialysis, and location of dialysis were estimated. The annual costs of each dialysis modality were calculated and included the cost of dialysis sessions and additional costs (including the cost of peritoneal and vascular access, hospitalisation costs due to potential complications of dialysis, cost of health care personnel, and cost of health care transport used by patients). Population data and costs (€, 2024) were obtained from the Spanish databases and a nephrologist validated the assumptions. Budget impact analysis assessed the incremental budget impact between the current scenario and the alternative scenario, where 30% of incident patients on scheduled HD would receive PD. RESULTS: We estimated that in Spain, there are 27,281 prevalent dialysis patients (3,141 receiving PD and 24,140 receiving HD/HDF) and 6,052 incident dialysis patients (1,173 receiving PD and 4,879 HD/HDF).

The policy transition including out-of-pocket payment requirement may discourage vaccination, leading to a lower vaccination rate. This study aimed to estimate the impact of varying vaccination rates with BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on economics and public health in an illustrative prefecture which administers and promotes the periodic vaccination program, using budget impact analysis. METHODS: A combined cohort Markov decision tree model estimated the public health outcomes of COVID-19-related symptomatic cases, hospitalizations and deaths; and the economic outcomes including vaccine-related cost, non-vaccine-related medical cost, and productivity loss from the societal perspective. The base case examined the impact on the outcomes when vaccination coverage changed from the reference value of 50% to upper and lower values, respectively. Scenario analyses were performed based on multiple scenarios. RESULTS: Increase in the vaccination rate demonstrated improvement in all public health outcomes. At 50% vaccination, the vaccine-related cost for 3 years in a prefecture was estimated at JPY 7.58 billion (USD 57.67 million), the non-vaccine-related medical cost at JPY 79.22 billion (USD 602.48 million), the productivity loss at JPY 253.11 billion (USD 1.92 billion), and the total cost at JPY 339.92 billion (USD 2.59 billion). When the vaccination rate increased to 90%, the total cost decreased by JPY 4.88 billion (USD 37.11 million) (1.4%).

To mitigate this, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) recommends annual COVID-19 vaccination, but uptake remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the public health and economic impact of annual mRNA COVID-19 vaccination for adults aged 50 and older in South Korea during the 2024–2025 season, focusing on hospitalizations and costs. Methods: We estimated hospitalizations prevented by the mRNA-1273 XBB.1.5 containing vaccine by calculating symptomatic infection incidence rates, hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, and vaccination rates. Incidence rates among the unvaccinated with an annual vaccine were derived by adjusting overall infection rates based on vaccination coverage and VE against COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Hospitalization costs were obtained from a real-world dataset, integrating the KDCA’s COVID-19 confirmed cases with National Health Insurance claims data. Comparative analyses between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 used published meta-analysis results. Results: Assuming vaccination rates remain consistent with the 2023–2024 season, mRNA-1273 is projected to prevent 37,200 hospitalizations and save USD 77.2 million in healthcare costs during the 2024–2025 season compared to no annual vaccination. Compared to BNT162b2, it is expected to prevent an additional 13,260 hospitalizations saving USD 27.5 million. If vaccination rates increased to match influenza, hospitalizations prevented by mRNA-1273 could rise to 79,800 with USD 164.2 million in healthcare savings compared to no annual vaccination.

This study evaluates the public health and economic impact of annual mRNA COVID-19 vaccination for adults aged 50 and older in South Korea during the 2024–2025 season, focusing on hospitalizations and costs. Methods: We estimated hospitalizations prevented by the mRNA-1273 XBB.1.5 containing vaccine by calculating symptomatic infection incidence rates, hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, and vaccination rates. Incidence rates among the unvaccinated with an annual vaccine were derived by adjusting overall infection rates based on vaccination coverage and VE against COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Hospitalization costs were obtained from a real-world dataset, integrating the KDCA’s COVID-19 confirmed cases with National Health Insurance claims data. Comparative analyses between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 used published meta-analysis results. Results: Assuming vaccination rates remain consistent with the 2023–2024 season, mRNA-1273 is projected to prevent 37,200 hospitalizations and save USD 77.2 million in healthcare costs during the 2024–2025 season compared to no annual vaccination.

RESULTS: For 9,450 cases, an average budget impact for scenario A and scenario B of €1,290.41 [95% CI €1,119.64 - €1,461.19] and - €208.59 [95% CI - €379.36 - - €37.81] was identified for gastrointestinal and kidney surgery cases, and €1,355.58 [95% CI €1,049.62 - €1,661.55] and €18.72 [95% CI - €324.69 - €287.24] for vascular artery surgery cases, respectively. The break-even analysis showed that using two tests per case could achieve a minimum positive contribution margin with an average of 1.9 tests per case across the study population. CONCLUSION: The results revealed a positive budget impact for one NGS test and a slightly negative budget impact for two NGS tests per case.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a three-part economic evaluation of iCAN, including a (1) cost analysis, (2) exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis, and (3) budget impact analysis (BIA).

Costs were calculated PPPY under different scenarios, and the results were used as inputs in a BIA. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate uncertainty around cost estimates. Costs are in 2022 US $. RESULTS: The total cost of iCAN was US $2865 PPPY, which was made up of US $265 in startup (9%) and US $2600 (91%) in recurring costs PPPY. The minimum savings threshold that would cause iCAN to have a positive return on investment is 7.8%. This means that if average health care costs (US $36,917) among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. When health care costs are reduced by 25% ($9229/$36,917; equal to 56% [$9229/$16,609] of the average cost of an inpatient visit), the benefit-cost ratio is 3.22, which means that iCAN produces US $2.22 in health care savings per US $1 spent. The BIA estimated that implementing iCAN for 10,250 people experiencing homelessness over 5 years would have a financial cost of US $28.7 million, which could be reduced to US $2.2 million if at least 8% ($2880/$36,917) of average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness are reduced through the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: If average costs of emergency department and hospital visits among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% ($2880/$36,917) through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a three-part economic evaluation of iCAN, including a (1) cost analysis, (2) exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis, and (3) budget impact analysis (BIA). METHODS: We collected cost and expenditure data from a randomized controlled trial of iCAN to conduct a cost analysis and exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis. Costs were classified as startup and recurring costs for participants and the program. Startup costs included participant supplies for each participant and SMS implementation costs. Recurring costs included the cost of recurring services, SMS text messaging platform maintenance, health information access fees, and personnel salaries. Using the per participant per year (PPPY) costs of iCAN, the minimum savings reduction in the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness that would lead to a benefit-cost ratio >1 for iCAN was calculated. This savings threshold was calculated by dividing the PPPY cost of iCAN by the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness multiplied by 100%.

METHODS: The BIA compared costs of 100 MI-TLIF and 100 O-TLIF procedures from an Italian hospital perspective over a one-year time horizon.

We conducted a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of home-based versus facility-based TPT provision for child contacts in Ethiopia. As part of the CHIP TB trial, a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial conducted at eighteen clinics in Ethiopia, clinics were randomized to either a home-based model (intervention arm), administered by community health workers, or a facility-based model (standard of care) for managing child contacts. Cost data were collected from both a health service perspective and a household perspective, capturing all costs relevant to TPT. Costs were evaluated on a per-household basis, with the primary outcome being the difference in median costs per household initiating TPT. A secondary outcome assessed the cost-effectiveness as the incremental cost per additional child contact starting TPT. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to examine the robustness of findings. At an average cost of US$18.92 per household managed, Home-based contact management, including TPT delivery was cost-saving compared to facility-based TPT delivery (US$27.24 per household managed) assessed based on the partial-societal perspectives, largely due to reductions in household out-of-pocket costs. The home-based strategy was both less costly and had increased TPT initiation in 61.5% of the scenarios assessed in the PSA. Home-based contact management is a cost-saving alternative for households and provides comparable initiation rates to facility-based care, making it a feasible approach to improve TB preventive treatment accessibility. Although it does not entirely replace facility-based care, a hybrid model that respects household preferences and allows flexibility in delivery could enhance TB care access for socio-economically disadvantaged households, potentially reducing health inequities.

METHODS: A BIA model was developed to calculate the expected financial impact under two scenarios: the baseline scenario, which reflects the current mix of treatments without baricitinib, and the projected scenario, in which baricitinib is adopted. The model assumed that patients with severe AA and those with mild-to-moderate AA who did not respond to other treatments were eligible for baricitinib treatment. The model input was based on published evidence, expert opinions, and the Saudi Expert Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of AA. RESULTS: Assuming a hypothetical total eligible population of 368 patients received different AA treatments over the 12-months study period. The aggregated 5-years cost in the baseline scenario was SR 5,836,616. Upon the introduction of baricitinib as an alternative treatment for severe AA, the projected aggregated budget impact was SR 7,473,138. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were most sensitive to AA prevalence, percentage of severe AA, and predicted market share for baricitinib over the 5-year time horizon. CONCLUSION: The addition of baricitinib to formularies is likely to increase the cost impact from a government hospital perspective.

However, the cost effectiveness of DRd versus KRd is unknown. METHODS: We developed a Markov model by using an Iranian payer perspective and a 10-year time horizon to estimate the healthcare cost, Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years gain (LYG) for DRd and KRd triplet therapies. Clinical data were obtained from meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess model uncertainty. Budget impact analysis of 5 years of treatment under the DRd triplet therapy was also analysed. RESULTS: DRd was estimated to be more effective compared to KRd, providing 0.28 QALY gain over the modelled horizon. DRd-treated patients incurred $264 in total additional costs. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) and cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were $956/QALY and $472/LYG respectively. The budget impact analysis indicates that adding Daratumumab to Lenalidomide and dexamethasone regimen, in the first 5 years, will increase the healthcare system's expenses by $6.170.582.

In our study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd compared with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for this indication in Finland. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival analysis model was developed with a payer’s perspective. Time to event data from the DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03) trial were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon either directly—for progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation—or using an alternative approach utilizing long-term T-DM1 survival data and DB-03 data—for overall survival. Discount rates of 3% were applied for costs and effects. Inputs were sourced from the Medicinal Products Database from Kela, Helsinki University Hospital service price list, Finnish Medicines Agency assessments, clinical experts, and DB-03. Sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize and demonstrate parameter uncertainties in the model. Results: Total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) gained for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were 1.93 and 2.56, respectively. Incremental costs for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were €106,800, resulting in an ICER of €55,360 per QALY gained and an ICER of €41,775 per LY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the hazard ratio of T-DXd vs T-DM1 for OS was the most influential parameter. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed similar results to the base case.

In our study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd compared with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for this indication in Finland. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival analysis model was developed with a payer’s perspective. Time to event data from the DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03) trial were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon either directly—for progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation—or using an alternative approach utilizing long-term T-DM1 survival data and DB-03 data—for overall survival. Discount rates of 3% were applied for costs and effects. Inputs were sourced from the Medicinal Products Database from Kela, Helsinki University Hospital service price list, Finnish Medicines Agency assessments, clinical experts, and DB-03. Sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize and demonstrate parameter uncertainties in the model. Results: Total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) gained for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were 1.93 and 2.56, respectively. Incremental costs for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were €106,800, resulting in an ICER of €55,360 per QALY gained and an ICER of €41,775 per LY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the hazard ratio of T-DXd vs T-DM1 for OS was the most influential parameter. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed similar results to the base case.

10032398,Ngan TT,Budget impact analysis of a home-based colorectal cancer screening programme in Malaysia,BMJ Open,2023.0,"- OBJECTIVES: The 2020-2022 research project 'Colorectal Cancer Screening Intervention for Malaysia' (CRC-SIM) evaluated the implementation of a home-based CRC screening pilot in Segamat District. This budget impact analysis (BIA) assessed the expected changes in health expenditure of the Malaysian Ministry of Health budget in the scenario where the pilot programme was implemented nationwide vs current opportunistic screening. DESIGN: Budget impact analysis. Assumptions and costs in the opportunistic and novel CRC screening scenarios were derived from a previous evaluation of opportunistic CRC screening in community health clinics across Malaysia and the CRC-SIM research project, respectively. SETTING: National level (with supplement analysis for district level). The BIA was conducted from the viewpoint of the federal government and estimated the annual financial impact over a period of 5 years. RESULTS: The total annual cost of the current practice of opportunistic screening was RM1 584 321 (~I$1 099 460) of which 80% (RM1 274 690 or ~I$884 587) was expended on the provision of opportunistic CRC to adults who availed of the service. Regarding the implementation of national CRC screening programme, the net budget impact in the first year was estimated to be RM107 631 959 (~I$74 692 546) and to reach RM148 485 812 (~I$103 043 589) in the fifth year based on an assumed increased uptake of 5% annually. The costs were calculated to be sensitive to the probability of adults who were contactable, eligible and agreeable to participating in the programme.

11927220,Maphanga B,The budget impact analysis of nicotine replacement therapy among patients who smoke tobacco and have mental illness in South Africa and the implications,BMC Health Serv Res,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death, with the highest burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those who have mental illness are particularly vulnerable, with a smoking rate two to five times higher than that of the general population. Quitting smoking has demonstrated benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving the quality of life. However, the economic feasibility of introducing Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the psychiatric medical environment in South Africa has not yet been explored. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the impact on the budget of implementing an NRT-based smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study followed a budget impact analysis framework. Data were retrieved between May 19 and Aug 18, 2023, from 214 patients' medical records. Using primary and secondary data, an ingredients costing approach was used to estimate direct treatment costs of NRT smoking cessation. All costs were expressed in ZAR (South African currency). The economic evaluation was conducted from the payer's perspective, and the results were reported at a 5% discount rate. A two-way 10% sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The study showed that study participants were primarily black, male, unemployed, diagnosed with schizophrenia and smoked lightly (69.16% ±3.46). Implementing the 3-month treatment period of NRT smoking cessation program would result in an expenditure of R1 478 915.42 for 214 patients. The hospital will require an additional 0.15% (±0.0095) of the total hospital budget and 6.09% (±0.31) of the hospital pharmacy budget. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that while implementing a NRT is crucial for improving the overall health outcomes among patients with mental illnesses, substantial investment would be required.

The review objectives are to compare the efficacy and safety of these antivirals based on published RCT and real-world data, and to evaluate costs from a healthcare perspective. METHODS: This study provides a network meta-analysis of RDV and NRM/RTV for early treatment of COVID-19. The outcomes analysed were hospitalisation for any cause and serious adverse events. A cost-analysis was performed incorporating drug costs, administration, hospitalisations, and management of adverse events. A budget impact analysis was estimated for the University Hospital of Padua. RESULTS: Our results indicated that RDV showed a trend towards a lower risk of hospitalisation compared to NRM/RTV (RR 1.59, 95% CI: 0.60-4.20), though this was not statistically significant. For safety, NRM/RTV demonstrated a slightly lower risk of serious adverse events compared to RDV (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.31-2.74), but without statistical significance. A cost analysis showed that NRM/RTV could save €550,854.46 per 1,000 patients. Finally, a budget impact analysis based on data from the University Hospital of Padua estimated annual savings of €210,977.25 if all early treatments were administered with NRM/RTV instead of RDV.

The review objectives are to compare the efficacy and safety of these antivirals based on published RCT and real-world data, and to evaluate costs from a healthcare perspective. METHODS: This study provides a network meta-analysis of RDV and NRM/RTV for early treatment of COVID-19. The outcomes analysed were hospitalisation for any cause and serious adverse events. A cost-analysis was performed incorporating drug costs, administration, hospitalisations, and management of adverse events. A budget impact analysis was estimated for the University Hospital of Padua. RESULTS: Our results indicated that RDV showed a trend towards a lower risk of hospitalisation compared to NRM/RTV (RR 1.59, 95% CI: 0.60-4.20), though this was not statistically significant. For safety, NRM/RTV demonstrated a slightly lower risk of serious adverse events compared to RDV (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.31-2.74), but without statistical significance. A cost analysis showed that NRM/RTV could save €550,854.46 per 1,000 patients. Finally, a budget impact analysis based on data from the University Hospital of Padua estimated annual savings of €210,977.25 if all early treatments were administered with NRM/RTV instead of RDV. DISCUSSION: The comparison of the two antiviral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 did not yield statistically significant differences in the potential efficacy and safety to prevent hospitalisation or serious adverse events.

METHODS: We estimated the population of adult Pakistani migrants registered at the primary care centres in Catalonia by means of the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (n=37 972 in 2019, Barcelona health area). This cohort was followed for a time period of 10 years after HCV diagnosis (2019-2028). The statistical significance of the differences observed in the anti-HCV positivity rate between screened and non-screened was confirmed (α=0.05). The budget impact was calculated from the perspective of the Catalan Department of Health.

The average cost per controlled patient was higher in the TELE-DD group than in the control group at 6 months (€160.31 vs. €49.79), but lower at 12 (€150.09 vs. €179.59) and 18 months (€209.22 vs. €376.88). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 6, 12, and 18 months was €254.47, €143.65, and €177.46, respectively. The budget impact analysis revealed that implementing the TELE-DD program would result in a reduction of €721,940.68 in expenditure for the funder in the first year of application. Conclusions: A nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression is an efficient option in the management of healthcare resources.

Design: Secondary analysis of cost-consequence and budget impact, utilizing data from a randomized clinical trial conducted in the primary healthcare setting. The target population consisted of Type 2 diabetic patients with comorbid depression who were nonadherent to their pharmacological treatment. Method: The average cost per controlled patient (glycated hemoglobin < 7%) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Similarly, the budgetary impact over 1 year of implementing this program in the region of reference of the randomized clinical trial was assessed. Results: The number of controlled patients is higher in the TELE-DD group at 6, 12, and 18 months.

BC subtype guides the standard systemic therapy administered, which consists of endocrine therapy for all HR + tumors, trastuzumab-based HER2-directed antibody therapy plus chemotherapy for all HER2 + tumors (with endocrine therapy given in addition, if concurrent HR positivity), and chemotherapy alone for the triple-negative subtype. This study aimed to identify, evaluate, and systematically review all budget impact analyses (BIAs) of BC medications worldwide.

It should also be noted that increasing or decreasing costs in the short term should not be the basis for the entry and exit of drugs from the drug list. A long-term budget impact must be made to judge reducing or increasing costs properly. For example, new medications with sound effects and high prices usually increase the cost of treatment. While in the long term, these drugs can reduce treatment costs. Through the long-term budget time horizon studies, the increase or decrease in budget trend could be seen to predict whether funding was affordable or not. To make better use of BIA studies, the focus should be on expensive cancer drugs that impose a more significant economic burden on the health system and subtypes of breast cancer that have a higher incidence rate in different communities.""",Discussion

In this budget impact analysis, the cost impact of CGM was compared with traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with T2DM over 1 year from the commissioner perspective in England. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The NICE-eligible T2DM cohort was split into 4 subgroups to enable nuanced costing by insulin administration frequency: basal human insulin, premixed insulin, basal-bolus insulin and bolus insulin. The model's cost components comprised mild and severe hypoglycaemia (SH), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), consumables and healthcare resource utilisation in primary and secondary care. RESULTS: The introduction of CGM is estimated to be cost additive by approximately £4.6 million in the basecase, driven by increased spending on the CGM device. Overall, healthcare activity was reduced by approximately 20,000 attendances, due to fewer SH and DKA episodes in the CGM arm. General Practitioner (GP) practice-based activity is expected to drop after the first year as patients requiring CGM training is reduced. The budget impact could be neutralised if the CGM sensor was discounted by 13.2% (£29.76 to £25.83). CONCLUSIONS: CGM may result in increased spending in the NICE-eligible T2DM cohort but is expected to reduce demand on secondary care services and GP time.

In this budget impact analysis, the cost impact of CGM was compared with traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with T2DM over 1 year from the commissioner perspective in England. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The NICE-eligible T2DM cohort was split into 4 subgroups to enable nuanced costing by insulin administration frequency: basal human insulin, premixed insulin, basal-bolus insulin and bolus insulin. The model's cost components comprised mild and severe hypoglycaemia (SH), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), consumables and healthcare resource utilisation in primary and secondary care. RESULTS: The introduction of CGM is estimated to be cost additive by approximately £4.6 million in the basecase, driven by increased spending on the CGM device. Overall, healthcare activity was reduced by approximately 20,000 attendances, due to fewer SH and DKA episodes in the CGM arm. General Practitioner (GP) practice-based activity is expected to drop after the first year as patients requiring CGM training is reduced. The budget impact could be neutralised if the CGM sensor was discounted by 13.2% (£29.76 to £25.83).

Evaluating the time and cost of surgical pack use is particularly important for publicly funded healthcare systems with tight budgets and/or an emphasis on value-based care. This study sought to estimate the economic impact of comprehensive surgical pack use in cataract and vitreoretinal (retina) surgeries across operating room (OR), materials management, and accounting departments in Canada. METHODS: A budget impact model developed for the United States (US) from a self-reported cross-sectional study was adapted for Canada. The US study obtained data via an online survey and timing exercises of surgical procedures. The model was adapted using relevant Canadian-specific labor and cost inputs. Use of generic commodity packs (no proprietary equipment-specific supplies) was compared to full utilization of Custom-Pak(®), a comprehensive pack (disposables plus equipment-specific supplies) in cataract and retina surgeries at the facility and aggregate group (provincewide) levels. RESULTS: Switching from generic to comprehensive pack use in all 2500 cataract procedures at a community hospital saves 287 labor hours per year, primarily in the materials management department. Surgery preparation (OR) hours saved allow for an additional 196 potential procedures annually. Most of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) $39,815 annual cost savings are realized for the OR. Aggregating across 50,000 cataract surgeries at the provincial level yields savings of 5608 hours and 3916 additional procedures, translating to hidden cost reductions of CAD$790,632 annually. Implementing full Custom-Pak use at the facility level in 1000 retina cases saves $10,650 annually; provincewide, 127 potential additional procedures can be gained.

Evaluating the time and cost of surgical pack use is particularly important for publicly funded healthcare systems with tight budgets and/or an emphasis on value-based care. This study sought to estimate the economic impact of comprehensive surgical pack use in cataract and vitreoretinal (retina) surgeries across operating room (OR), materials management, and accounting departments in Canada. METHODS: A budget impact model developed for the United States (US) from a self-reported cross-sectional study was adapted for Canada. The US study obtained data via an online survey and timing exercises of surgical procedures. The model was adapted using relevant Canadian-specific labor and cost inputs. Use of generic commodity packs (no proprietary equipment-specific supplies) was compared to full utilization of Custom-Pak(®), a comprehensive pack (disposables plus equipment-specific supplies) in cataract and retina surgeries at the facility and aggregate group (provincewide) levels. RESULTS: Switching from generic to comprehensive pack use in all 2500 cataract procedures at a community hospital saves 287 labor hours per year, primarily in the materials management department. Surgery preparation (OR) hours saved allow for an additional 196 potential procedures annually. Most of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) $39,815 annual cost savings are realized for the OR. Aggregating across 50,000 cataract surgeries at the provincial level yields savings of 5608 hours and 3916 additional procedures, translating to hidden cost reductions of CAD$790,632 annually. Implementing full Custom-Pak use at the facility level in 1000 retina cases saves $10,650 annually; provincewide, 127 potential additional procedures can be gained.

METHODS: A BIA model was used to estimate the cost difference between the current scenario (without olaparib) and the new scenario (incorporation of olaparib) for a third-party payer over a 5-year time horizon. The budgetary impact is estimated at the national health system level and by healthcare sectors in Argentina. Input parameters were obtained from the literature and validated by local expert opinion. Direct medical costs were obtained from both the Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy (IECS) unit cost database and public data in Argentina. The microcosting estimation was used for key variables of the analysis. All costs are reported in US dollars (US$) as for October 2022 (1 US$ = 152.59 Argentine pesos). One-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate the model robustness. RESULTS: The incorporation of olaparib, with a wholesale price per pack of US$3176, was associated with a weighted average of the budget impact per member per month (PMPM) of US$0.0191 for the national health system, being slightly higher than the estimated budgeted high impact threshold (US$0.0153). The PMPM budget impact for a 5-year average ranged between US$0.007 (public sector) and US$0.033 (private sector). The duration of treatment with olaparib was the most influential parameter in the budget impact results.

First, due to the absence of local epidemiological evidence, data from other countries and contexts were utilized. While we had a local oncology expert who reviewed, adapted, and validated the epidemiological evidence for the Argentine context, it is important to highlight that relying on a single expert is also a limitation. Second, our findings rely on market share projections for olaparib, which introduces an element of uncertainty. We tested this uncertainty in the DSA, but based on the analyses, the parameters seem not to drive big changes in the final outcomes of the BIM. On the other hand, we relied on indirect estimates to calculate the HRR test cost for the third-party social security and public payer perspectives. In addition, given that the HRR test is only available in Argentina through some private providers, and we did not have available information regarding future rates of test accessibility, we assumed a hypothetical scenario where there were no differences in the rate of access based on healthcare.""",Discussion

In South Africa, diabetes-related complications severely impact not only patient health and quality of life but also the economy. OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Nurse Educator (DNE) study assessed the benefit of adding the MyDiaCare program to standard of care for managing patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in South Africa. An economic study was also performed to estimate the budget impact of adding MyDiaCare to standard of care for patients with type 2 diabetes older than 19 years treated in the South African private health care sector. METHODS: The real-world DNE study was designed as an observational, retrospective, multicenter, single-group study. Eligible patients were older than 18 years and had at least 6 months of participation in the MyDiaCare program. The MyDiaCare program combines a patient mobile app and a health care professional platform with face-to-face visits with a DNE. The benefit of MyDiaCare was assessed by the changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, the proportion of patients achieving clinical and biological targets, adherence to care plans, and satisfaction after 6 months of participating in the MyDiaCare program. A budget impact model was performed using data from the DNE study and another South African cohort of the DISCOVERY study to estimate the economic impact of MyDiaCare. RESULTS: Between November 25, 2019, and June 30, 2020, a total of 117 patients (8 with type 1 diabetes and 109 with type 2 diabetes) were enrolled in 2 centers. After 6 months of MyDiaCare, a clinically relevant decrease in mean HbA(1c) levels of 0.6% from 7.8% to 7.2% was observed. Furthermore, 54% (43/79) of patients reached or maintained their HbA(1c) targets at 6 months. Most patients achieved their targets for blood pressure (53/79, 67% for systolic and 70/79, 89% for diastolic blood pressure) and lipid parameters (49/71, 69% for low-density-lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, 41/71, 58% for high-density-lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and 59/71, 83% for total cholesterol), but fewer patients achieved their targets for triglycerides (32/70, 46%), waist circumference (12/68, 18%), and body weight (13/76, 17%). The mean overall adherence to the MyDiaCare care plan was 93%. Most patients (87/117, 74%) were satisfied with the MyDiaCare program. The net budget impact per patient with type 2 diabetes, older than 19 years, treated in the private sector using MyDiaCare was estimated to be approximately South African Rands (ZAR) 71,023 (US $4089) during the first year of introducing MyDiaCare.

METHOD: A Markov model with a 30-year time horizon was employed to simulate and assess different treatment strategies' cost-effectiveness. The study population comprised Iranian adults with NVAF, identified through specialist consultations, hospital visits, and archival record reviews. Direct medical costs, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs were included. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed using an EQ-5D questionnaire. This study utilized a cost-effectiveness threshold of $11 134 per QALY. RESULTS: Apixaban demonstrated superior cost-effectiveness compared to Rivaroxaban and Warfarin.

Therefore, a budget impact analysis was conducted to describe the economic consequences of using available DAA drugs comparing current treatment program and the proposed stratified treatment approach for HCV treatment in the country. The findings from this study can inform the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MoH)'s decision-making in relation to resource reallocation and policy development for hepatitis C disease. They can also contribute to the development of local clinical guidelines and a local treatment strategy for hepatitis C patients, which in turn can lead to better control of the disease.

10351593,Hamouda M,Budget Impact Analysis of Single-Inhaler Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol in Patients with Asthma in the Dubai Academic Healthcare Corporation,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2023.0,"- PURPOSE: Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disorder associated with substantial societal and economic burden globally, despite the availability of different treatment modalities. GSK has developed a once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT), comprised of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI); a combination of inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and long-acting β(2)-agonist for patients with uncontrolled asthma. A budget impact analysis was conducted to determine the financial impact of introducing FF/UMEC/VI SITT from the perspective of the Dubai Academic Healthcare Corporation (DAHC). METHODS: A budget impact model was constructed using an epidemiology-based approach and used to estimate the expected 5-year budget impact of including FF/UMEC/VI for the treatment of eligible patients within the DAHC in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The model included both pharmacy and efficacy-related costs. The perspective of the DAHC healthcare payer was adopted, thus only direct payer costs were included in the analysis. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the model structure, assumptions, and input parameters. RESULTS: The total budget impact was estimated to save 1 million United States Dollars (USD) over 5 years, with budget impacts of 0.08 million USD in Year 1; 0.14 million USD in Year 2; 0.22 million USD in Year 3; 0.28 million USD in Year 4; and 0.33 million USD in Year 5.

11280244,Armijo N,Budget impact analysis of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III non–small cell lung cancer in the context of the Chilean health care system,PLoS One,2024.0,"- BACKGROUND: Durvalumab, used as consolidation immunotherapy, has shown to improve survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer who respond to chemoradiotherapy, based on the most recent follow-up of PACIFIC. The Chilean healthcare system provides access to certain immunotherapies for this condition. The present study sought to estimate the budget impact of durvalumab versus standard of care in the context of the Chilean healthcare system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was adapted to compare two strategies: durvalumab as consolidation therapy and standard of care for treating stage III NSCLC. The number of patients eligible for treatment was estimated using published incidence data and modeled for a 5-year time horizon. Model inputs were based on published literature, and the duration of treatment was estimated using survival curves obtained from PACIFIC. Costs were estimated in Chilean pesos (CLP) and converted to USD dollars using an exchange rate of USD 1  =  CLP 827. Scenario analyses were performed to assess different subsequent therapy splits, variations in the target population and dosage of durvalumab. RESULTS: Durvalumab uptake projected total costs ranging from USD 1.27 in Year 1 to 8.5 million in Year 5 from the public perspective. From the private perspective, the budget impact for the first year is USD 1.3 million to USD 3 million for 2028. This difference relies mostly on the lower number of patients treated. Both perspectives anticipated cost savings over the time horizon through reduced monitoring, adverse events, and end-of-life expenses.

We sought to build on a previous cost-effectiveness analysis by evaluating the budget impact of adopting COPD case detection in the Canadian general population. METHODS: We used a validated discrete-event microsimulation model of COPD in the Canadian general population aged 40 years and older to assess the costs of implementing 8 primary care-based case detection strategies over 5 years (2022-2026) from the health care payer perspective. Strategies varied in eligibility criteria (based on age, symptoms or smoking history) and testing technology (COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire [CDQ] or screening spirometry). Costs were determined from Canadian studies and converted to 2021 Canadian dollars. Key parameters were varied in one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: All strategies resulted in higher total costs compared with routine diagnosis. The most cost-effective scenario (the CDQ for all patients) had an associated total budget expansion of $423 million, with administering case detection and subsequent diagnostic spirometry accounting for 86% of costs. This strategy increased the proportion of individuals diagnosed with COPD from 30.4% to 37.8%, and resulted in 4.6 million referrals to diagnostic spirometry.

Patient blood management (PBM) is a patient-centered approach based on a 'three pillar' model that promotes optimum use of blood and blood products to improve outcomes. This study assessed the potential budget impact of implementing PBM in patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery in a private hospital in Turkey. METHODS: Two models were developed to estimate the hospital budget impact of PBM. The first model encompassed implementation of the first pillar of PBM, which proposes treatment of iron deficiency anemia before a surgical procedure. The second covered implementation of all three pillars of PBM. Budget impact was estimated from the number of avoided complications after treating iron deficiency anemia and reducing blood transfusions. Rates of complication (sepsis, myocardial infarction, renal failure and stroke) with and without PBM were taken from published meta-analyses. Data on 882 cardiovascular operations performed during 2020-2022 were taken from the Florence Nightingale Istanbul Hospital. The costs of treating complications were estimated by applying Turkish Social Security Institution prices to a healthcare resource utilization tool for each complication completed by experts. RESULTS: Results from the budget impact analysis showed that, by implementing the first pillar of PBM, the department could have avoided 30 complications and saved 4,189,802 TRY. For the second model based on implementing all three pillars of PBM, 29 complications could have been avoided by reducing the number of transfusions, with budget savings of 6,174,434 TRY.

However, their efficacy has recently been demonstrated in heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with positive recommendations by Haute Autorité de Santé for gliflozin therapies in these indications. The study objective was to investigate the 5-year budget impact associated with the introduction of gliflozins in addition to standard therapy in people with CKD and elevated albuminuria, regardless of diabetes status, from the perspective of the French healthcare system. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the 5-year implications of incorporating gliflozins in the treatment of patients with CKD in France, using efficacy data from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Direct medical costs associated with drug acquisition and management, treatment-related adverse events, dialysis and kidney transplantation, and adverse clinical outcomes were considered. Market share forecasts were estimated from historical data and expert opinions. Event rates were derived from trial data, while cost data were sourced from published estimates. RESULTS: The introduction of gliflozins was estimated to be cost saving compared to the no gliflozins scenario, with an expected cumulative 5-year budget impact of -€650 million, driven by slowed disease progression in patients treated with gliflozins, with fewer patients cumulatively progressing to end-stage kidney disease (84,526 vs. 92,062). This, in addition to fewer hospitalisations for heart failure and deaths from any cause, led to substantial medical care cost offsets (kidney-related: - €894 million; hospitalisation for heart failure: - €14.3 million; end-of-life care: - €17.3 million) to the additional drug acquisition (€273 million) and treatment-related adverse events costs (€2.98 million). CONCLUSION: In concert with early diagnosis and proactive management of CKD, the expansion of the gliflozin indications into the French CKD population presents the opportunity to reduce the substantial burden associated with cardio-renal complications which outweighs the additional cost of the new treatment.

METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the 5-year implications of incorporating gliflozins in the treatment of patients with CKD in France, using efficacy data from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Direct medical costs associated with drug acquisition and management, treatment-related adverse events, dialysis and kidney transplantation, and adverse clinical outcomes were considered. Market share forecasts were estimated from historical data and expert opinions. Event rates were derived from trial data, while cost data were sourced from published estimates. RESULTS: The introduction of gliflozins was estimated to be cost saving compared to the no gliflozins scenario, with an expected cumulative 5-year budget impact of -€650 million, driven by slowed disease progression in patients treated with gliflozins, with fewer patients cumulatively progressing to end-stage kidney disease (84,526 vs. 92,062). This, in addition to fewer hospitalisations for heart failure and deaths from any cause, led to substantial medical care cost offsets (kidney-related: - €894 million; hospitalisation for heart failure: - €14.3 million; end-of-life care: - €17.3 million) to the additional drug acquisition (€273 million) and treatment-related adverse events costs (€2.98 million).

In South Africa, the prevalence of CKD increased by 67% between 1999 and 2006. Haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplant are the three main modalities used for managing end stage kidney disease. The cost of these therapies poses a significant burden to the health care system in South Africa. The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis from the societal perspective in South Africa. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis. The model was developed in excel and populated with clinical evidence and cost data synthesized from the literature. The costs and outcomes were estimated over a 5-year time-horizon. The outcomes were presented as quality-adjusted life years. Cost effectiveness was estimated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the robustness of the results. A budget impact model was constructed to estimate the impact of PD and HD over a 5 year period. RESULTS: The total discounted costs per patient over 5 years were R788 384 for PD versus R1 227 708 for HD. The incremental cost for providing PD was estimated at -R438 875. The net QALYs for delivering PD compared to HD were estimated at -0.09. Cost effectiveness ratio for PD versus PD was R5 096 154/QALY. At a threshold of R38 500, PD provision has a 79% probability of being cost-effective relative to HD. The INMB was estimated at R328 574 for PD and R322 194 for HD indicating the cost-effectiveness of PD. The budget impact analysis showed that it would cost government approximately R25 billion over 5 years to treat all individuals eligible for KRT under the current scenario of 88% HD and 12% PD.

This study is relevant to policymakers as the country prepares for the implementation of the NHI. A PD-preferred policy that considers clinical appropriateness and patients’ values should be considered as a mechanism to free up resources that could be used for other services.""",Conclusion
11748570,Thsehla E,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis in South Africa,BMC Health Serv Res,2025.0,"- BACKGROUND: More than 800 million people are affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. In South Africa, the prevalence of CKD increased by 67% between 1999 and 2006. Haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplant are the three main modalities used for managing end stage kidney disease. The cost of these therapies poses a significant burden to the health care system in South Africa. The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis from the societal perspective in South Africa. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis. The model was developed in excel and populated with clinical evidence and cost data synthesized from the literature. The costs and outcomes were estimated over a 5-year time-horizon. The outcomes were presented as quality-adjusted life years. Cost effectiveness was estimated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the robustness of the results. A budget impact model was constructed to estimate the impact of PD and HD over a 5 year period. RESULTS: The total discounted costs per patient over 5 years were R788 384 for PD versus R1 227 708 for HD. The incremental cost for providing PD was estimated at -R438 875. The net QALYs for delivering PD compared to HD were estimated at -0.09. Cost effectiveness ratio for PD versus PD was R5 096 154/QALY. At a threshold of R38 500, PD provision has a 79% probability of being cost-effective relative to HD. The INMB was estimated at R328 574 for PD and R322 194 for HD indicating the cost-effectiveness of PD. The budget impact analysis showed that it would cost government approximately R25 billion over 5 years to treat all individuals eligible for KRT under the current scenario of 88% HD and 12% PD. CONCLUSIONS: In South Africa, PD is shown to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of less than R38 500.

The potential effects of adopting ctDNA testing into routine patient care is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the total cost of patient care scenarios with and without the adoption of ctDNA testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This budget impact analysis was conducted from the perspectives of US commercial health and Medicare Advantage payers. A decision-analytical model was populated with age-specific incidence of colon cancer, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and use of single-agent or multiagent regimens.

The budget-neutral cost for ctDNA testing was $16 202 for a commercial payer and $5793 for a Medicare Advantage payer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in postsurgery patients with stage II colon cancer was projected to result in cost savings for both commercial and Medicare Advantage payers. Adoption of ctDNA testing is therefore advantageous from a budgetary perspective.",Patient Population; Article Information; ACT Regimen; Conclusions; Model Structure,"Which section does this sentence belong to: ""In clinical evaluation-based treatment, patients receiving ACT had 6 months of single-agent fluoropyrimidine or a multiagent regimen (combination of fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin) according to the age-specific rates reported in Manjelievskaia et al.""",ACT Regimen
