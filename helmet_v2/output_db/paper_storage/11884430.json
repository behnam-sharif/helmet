    "abstract": "- Background: Retinal diseases are major contributors to disability, significantly affecting patients\u2019 quality of life. Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) represent a significant disease and economic burden in Colombia. Assessing the economic evaluation of available treatments is essential for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using faricimab for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD within the Colombian health system. Methods: This study used a 25-year Markov cohort model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of faricimab vs aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab. We used the methodological guidelines of the local health technology assessment agency for conducting the cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. Transition probabilities and injection frequencies were derived from the literature. Drug prices were retrieved from public local databases. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. The potential patient population for the budget impact analysis was estimated based on disease prevalence and expert consultations. Results: Faricimab treat-and-extend (T&E) was dominant vs aflibercept T&E (+0.22 QALYs), ranibizumab T&E (+0.55 QALYs), and brolucizumab for 8 to 12 weeks (+0.06 QALYs) in DME, generating cost savings (in US dollars) of 3849,1375, and 2824,respectively.InnAMD,faricimabalsoshoweddominancevsafliberceptasneeded(+0.12Q ALYs),ranibizumabasneeded(+0.05QALYs),andbrolucizumab8to12weeks(+0.12QALYs)withsa vingsin(US)7223, 5792,and6798, respectively. Assuming an annual market share increase for faricimab of 15% for DME and 13% for nAMD, the Colombian Health System could save 144millionover3years.Ofthesesavings,122.7 million are attributed to drug costs and 21.3milliontoadministrationcosts(US1 = Col$4325). Conclusion: Considering a willingness to pay threshold of $5988 per additional QALY, faricimab is a cost-effective alternative for both DME and nAMD for the Colombian healthcare system, showing dominance over other anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Faricimab provides better health outcomes at lower costs vs other treatments.",
