    "abstract": "- Background and Aims:: In this cost-effectiveness model, we compared the cost-effectiveness of commonly used urinary biomarkers with conventional diuretic renogram (DR) in diagnosing ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). We hypothesized that urinary biomarkers are as effective as DR. Methods:: We used incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as a tool for our cost-effectiveness analysis model. The cost of biomarker assay and renogram were sourced from the same center while the accuracy data of DR and urinary biomarkers from the relevant pubications. Results:: As the accuracy of individual biomarker increased, the ICER also got better. As a panel of biomarker was introduced, the ICER went to the negative range suggesting cost saving as well. ICER of most urine biomarkers is currently less expensive and less effective. When a biomarker panel was applied ICER became more expensive and effective. With higher samples, test running cost is likely to go down in future and thus biomarkers are likely become less expensive and more effective. Conclusions:: Individual urine biomarkers are currently less expensive and less effective compared to DR in predicting UPJO. In future, biomarker panel is likely to be more cost-effective and reduce the need for invasive renogram thus reducing the radiation exposure.",
