        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p> Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital anomaly of the hip socket that can lead to severe disability and pain if not treated correctly. Standard early treatment, before the age of 6 months, is of a conservative nature with a Pavlik harness. After 6 months, an intervention under general anaesthesia in an operating theatre is necessary with an increasing need for open reduction and additional bony procedures with increasing age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The incidence of DDH ranges from 1.5 to 20/1000 live births, due to genetic differences between populations, differences in cultural habits (swaddling) and differences in diagnostic cut-offs and definitions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
        <p>Late presentation of DDH is still very common in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a subsequently increased need for expensive surgical treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2 3</sup></xref> Untreated DDH can lead to pain and degenerative hip problems starting in adolescence and continuing throughout adulthood.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> About 25% of total hip arthroplasties done before the age of 40 are done because of untreated or insufficiently treated DDH, making the societal impact of DDH non-negligible.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The patient-level impact of untreated DDH has been estimated to be similar to blindness or hyperthyroidism, with an estimated disability weight (DW) of 0.180.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 10</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Controversy remains in the literature about the most clinically effective type of screening for DDH: (1) clinical exam as the sole screening modality, (2) universal ultrasound (US) screening of hips in infants or (3) a combined approach where only infants with an abnormal clinical exam or certain risk factors for DDH are referred for further US diagnostics and follow-up.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">511</xref><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Controversy equally remains in literature about the most cost-effective type of screening because of a lack of high-quality effectiveness data and high-quality cost-effectiveness analyses.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
        <p>DDH can be considered a good candidate for screening because of its high frequency in the population, availability of treatment and the possibility of secondary prevention.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Introduction of screening in high-income countries has shown a decrease in surgical interventions for DDH,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6 13 16 21 22</sup></xref> and a majority of primary surgical interventions are less-invasive closed reductions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23 24</sup></xref> Mongolia is currently the only middle-income country with a generalised US screening programme, reaching 76% of all Mongolian newborns.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Pakistan is a lower-middle-income country in South Asia with an annual birth rate of about 6 million live births.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Pakistan currently does not have any systematic or universal neonatal screening programme for DDH in place. In 2018, the Pakistani government launched the ‘National Health Vision Pakistan 2025’ to strengthen the national health system including alleviating the burden of surgical disease in Pakistan.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The universal health coverage (UHC) package proposed by the Pakistani government to be implemented by 2030 includes an allocated budget line for ‘identification/screening of the early childhood development issues: motor, sensory and language stimulation’, which could potentially include DDH screening.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The actual burden of DDH is unknown, including the rate of access to conservative or surgical treatment.</p>
        <p>This study aims to develop a universally applicable cost-effectiveness model for DDH, increasing the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses being done and increasing comparability of results between countries. Additionally, this paper aims to determine the most cost-effective screening method for the Indus Hospital and Health Network (IHHN) in Karachi, Pakistan as an example of how the model can be used in practice.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <sec id="s2-1">
          <title>Model design</title>
          <p>The cost-effectiveness model developed and applied in this study used four different decision trees, one decision tree for each screening scenario. We modelled the following four scenarios: (1) the status quo, (2) universal screening by clinical examination, (3) universal screening by clinical examination with targeted US screening (4) and universal screening by US. The status quo refers to the current situation in Pakistan with an absence of a structured national or regional screening programme. Our model only takes idiopathic DDH into consideration and does not include children with hip subluxation or dislocations due to underlying neurological disorders, arthrogryposis or trauma. All analyses were performed using AMUA (AMUA, Zachary Ward, GitHub, 2022). The model is available as <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 1 and 2</xref>.</p>
          <p>Variables were entered into the model as distributions. Variables for which multiple data points were available were entered as normal distributions, variables with a single data point available were entered as triangular distributions with an artificial range of 5 percentage points above and below the available data point. For DDH prevalence, a range of 50 percentage points was used. This was done to capture the ongoing uncertainty about DDH prevalence in literature. For the cost variables, a range of 10 percentage points was used. A higher range was chosen here to reflect ongoing demands for salary increases for health workers globally, and the potential impact such a salary revalorisation may have. For the DW of DDH, a PERT distribution was applied, to reflect the fact that the DW used in this study has not been widely applied in literature before.</p>

          <title>Setting</title>
          <p>The IHHN is a not-for-profit hospital network in Karachi, Pakistan offering tertiary hospital-level health services free of cost.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> About 30 000 children are born within the network each year, leading to an estimated number of 75 children with DDH born within the network annually.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The IHHN currently does not have a dedicated screening programme for DDH but is exploring the option to implement one in the coming years.</p>

        <sec id="s2-3">
          <title>Variables, search strategy and data sources</title>
          <p>The variables used in the model were extracted from the current scientific literature on DDH. Articles were searched using PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms: “hip dysplasia” and “screening”. Included languages were limited to Dutch, French and English, to avoid the usage of translation software. No formal or standardised quality assessment tools were used to include/exclude articles, as data were in addition to its objective quality also judged subjectively on its representability of Pakistan and its appropriateness for usage as a proxy where necessary. The included data points have been extensively discussed with the entire research team before deciding on the final model inputs. The research team consists of physicians from six different countries, covering four different continents, including several members with extensive experience in the Pakistani context. Studies from journals with a high-impact factor, based on large cohorts using scientifically appropriate analysis techniques, published more recently, and where available, systematic reviews or international consensus documents on DDH, were prioritised to avoid bias in the selected variables. An overview of all the variables included in the model, their sources and the assumptions made, can be found in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 3</xref>.</p>
          <p>For context-independent variables, data sources were chosen based on the scientific quality of the analysis of the respective study, the quality of the journal, the size of the included cohort and how recently the paper was published. We aimed to include at least two high-quality data sources, using the aforementioned quality criteria, for each included variable. For variables with a high level of variability between studies, additional studies were searched for to increase the representativeness of the data included. For context-dependent variables, similar criteria were used, however, priority was given to studies from the Indian subcontinent, or the larger south Asian region. In case no south Asian studies were available, data were sourced from available studies from any middle-income country.</p>
          <p>Cost variables and the surgical procedure mix for DDH treatment were determined using 2021 data from the IHHN DDH registry and financial department. The baseline cost for surgical care was adjusted to capture the additional costs of reinterventions (13% at IHHN) and to capture the additional cost for children who have bilateral DDH and require treatment for both hips (37.8% at IHHN). All cost variables were converted from Pakistani Rupees to International Dollars using the most recently (2021) available PPP conversion factor for Pakistan, being 41.92 PKR/PPP$.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The DW for DDH and for DDH sequelae and complications are drawn from the literature.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9 10</sup></xref> Given the relative stability of PPP$ over time, the volatility of international currency exchange rates, and the fact that converting prices of non-internationally traded goods into another currency has little value, we opted to only display costs in the original currency (Pakistani rupees) and PPP$.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The PPP$ conversion rates allow any reader to convert the costs in this paper to any currency of their choice using the 2021 PPP$ conversion rates,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> taking into consideration the relative costs of the included goods in their respective country, allowing for a better interpretation of the actual cost implications of implementing one scenario or another.</p>
          <p>For variables where no data could be found about DDH, proxies were used from other diseases that resemble the screening methodology or treatment of DDH as closely as possible. These proxies include data from deafness screening programmes in lower-middle-income countries in West Africa and clubfoot programmes in south Asia. Deafness is screened for in newborns using a two-stage screening with universal screening for the first stage and additional targeted screening for infants who failed the first stage.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These data were used to model the attrition rate for screening by clinical exam in the maternity ward and the attrition rate for second-stage US screening after referral. Completion and adherence rates for Ponseti treatment for clubfoot were used as a proxy to estimate expected completion and adherence rates for DDH treatment after screening and diagnosis.</p>

          <title>Bias</title>
          <p>A sensitivity analysis was executed for all variables in the model. The sensitivity analysis allowed variable to differ across the ranges of distributions of each variable. An overview of the values included in the sensitivity analysis can be found in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 4</xref>. A variation of more than 10% in the cost or number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost per scenario was considered significant and a potential source of bias in the model.</p>

The DALYs lost due to the potential development of osteoarthritis postsurgery or in untreated cases of DDH are not included in this analysis, given that DALYs lost after the age of 40 years contribute very little to the model when applying a discounting factor of 5%. The results and CIs were obtained by running the model with 10 000 iterations and 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

        <p>Our model generates 82 different paths to follow across 4 scenarios (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 1 and 2</xref>). The cost breakdown and total cost for each scenario are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. It shows that the current status quo is the least expensive scenario and screening by universal clinical exam only is the most expensive. When left untreated DDH creates a loss of 3.4 DALYs per person with untreated DDH (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). This number is significantly higher than the DALYs lost per person due to DDH treated with surgery or DDH treated conservatively but with residual complications.</p>

        <p>The cost-effectiveness of each model is appraised in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> where the DALYs lost and costs of each scenario are brought together. Universal US screening clearly renders the largest number of DALYs averted. Clinical examination and targeted US have the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and thus generate the biggest gain in DALYs averted per cost of all three screening options. However, generalised US averts more DALYs overall but requires a larger financial cost per DALY averted. Therefore, depending on the willingness-to-pay per DALY averted, screening by clinical exam and targeted US or universal US screening are cost-effective alternatives to the current status quo (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p>

The prevalence of DDH and the variability in the DW for untreated DDH are the two single most important variables influencing the number of DALYs lost per scenario. All other variables have only a small to negligible impact. The variables influencing the cost differ greatly between scenarios. The cost of the status quo depends mainly on the specificity of clinical examination, the prevalence of DDH and the number of children receiving screening or having access to surgical care for DDH. In the scenario with only clinical examination, only the specificity of clinical examination influences the cost significantly. In the scenario with clinical examination and targeted US, the cost is influenced significantly by the prevalence of DDH, the specificity of clinical examination and the accessibility of surgical care. For the scenario with generalised US screening only, the cost is impacted significantly only by the percentage of children that receive treatment with a Pavlik harness instead of follow-up with US.</p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>For Pakistan, screening by universal US or by clinical examination and targeted US are both cost-effective options to consider for implementing a screening programme for DDH at the hospital level. Although both options are considered cost-effective, they require a very different annual investment at the hospital level. For an estimated 30 000 annual births at IHHN, the additional costs for screening by clinical examination and targeted US would amount to PPP$30 000 while implementing a universal US screening programme would require an additional investment of PPP$300 000 per year. In order to make an informed decision between the available options, several arguments must be taken into consideration: willingness-to-pay thresholds, equity and available resources. The national UHC package for Pakistan allocates PPP$447 502 towards childhood developmental screening programmes for the entire country,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> an amount that is unable to cover the costs of our proposed screening programme at this time.</p>
        <p>Conservatively treated DDH without complications incurs no loss of DALYs, as it has no further impact on life after treatment other than the elimination of the effects of DDH. As stated earlier, the DALYs lost due to the potential development of osteoarthritis in middle age are not included in this analysis. The DW for hip osteoarthritis is estimated at 0.165<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> and is, therefore, smaller than the DW of untreated DDH. It is understood that the impact of osteoarthritis in these patients is already included in the DW for DDH together with other complications and impacts.</p>
        <p>High-income countries usually apply a willingness-to-pay threshold of PPP$50 000 per DALY averted, a threshold easily met for all options in this study.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Little information is available about willingness-to-pay thresholds in LMICs, but data from Thailand and Malaysia show much lower thresholds of around PPP$20 000 per DALY averted through medical treatment and as low as PPP$2 000 per DALY averted for preventive strategies.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30 38</sup></xref> When applying these thresholds, only clinical examination and targeted US fall below the threshold.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons the costs of the clinical examination and targeted US model are so low is that the model included only a 59% turnout for the targeted USs, lowering the costs of treatment and follow-up to a minimum (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Although we do not have data on the characteristics of the people who do and who do not attend the second-stage screening through US, the available data from clubfoot programmes across LMICs show that poverty is the main cross-cutting factor for dropping out of treatment.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Therefore, we can assume that the poorer children in society have a higher risk of failing to follow-up with two-step screening, making universal US screening the more equitable option. It is also important to note that the rate of surgery goes up in the scenarios with a high screening attrition rate. This counterintuitive effect is due to the assumption in the model that all children with a failed conservative treatment for DDH or post-treatment sequelae will access surgery. Given that the access to surgery for DDH in children not screened for DDH, was modelled at 10% only, the number of children requiring surgical care for failed DDH inefficient screening programmes turns out to be higher than the number of children access surgical care for DDH on the absence of screening. This phenomenon should be seen as an effect of increased access to care, and thus as an increased utilisation of services and not as an indication of the inefficiency of screening.</p>
        <p>Lastly, resource utilisation differs greatly between both options. Universal US screening creates the largest need for follow-up by trained orthopaedic surgeons in all the scenarios. Orthopaedic surgeons themselves can be considered a ‘resource’, a ‘resource’ that may not be readily available in the Pakistani health system due to known health workforce shortage challenges. This leads to other constraints in the health system planning than mere financial constraints and constraints that may not be alleviated with financial means in the short run. An important strength of our model is that it allows the use of different outcome variables. If the health system experiences other larger constraints than finances, such as a lack of surgeons/nurses/US machine, these outcomes can be used instead of cost to determine the most effective and feasible scenario to be implemented.</p>
        <p>The population density and health facility distribution where USs can be done should also be considered to ensure that the programme can cover the target population. It must be feasible for patients and caregivers to visit health facilities. In areas where visits are feasible but cumbersome or where ability to retain access to patients is difficult, full screening before discharge may be preferable. It is also vital to contemplate how different aspects of each programme would be received by society from multiple perspectives. For example, having a screening programme that is completed before discharge could result in a longer stay at the maternity ward may not be practical in communities where there are high rates of informal labour, as increased hospital stay may result in loss of wages.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
        <p>Executing a high-quality cost-effectiveness analysis proves difficult in the absence of the required data. In this study, many assumptions had to be made. For instance, the degree to which the Pavlik harness is visible or impedes care is not taken into consideration in our analysis, even though compliance with the Pavlik harness may well be lower than that with the brace used to correct clubfoot.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41 42</sup></xref> Nevertheless, clubfoot is the closest available proxy measure. It is, therefore, not unreasonable that initiation and adherence rates for DDH treatment may be lower than for clubfoot, although this may be offset by the shorter treatment course that is necessary, thereby generating lower drop-out rates.</p>
        <p>We believe our model, in essence the underlying decision tree, is context-independent and can be used by other countries and settings to assess the most cost-effective screening modality taking into consideration financial or contextual constraints and societal preferences. Our model covers the entire patient journey from screening, to accessing treatment, adhering to treatment and completing treatment with or without complications. This patient journey in itself is similar across settings, however, with very different probabilities for a patient to follow one path over another. As such, in order to use this model in other settings than Pakistan, local/regional data collection or identification of proxies is necessary to run the model. The extensiveness of the model also stimulates policy-makers or physicians to reflect on certain probabilities that may not automatically be perceived as important or impactful in their setting. But it is important to remember that no health system achieves 100% screening rates, health system accessibility, adherence or positive outcomes, and thus every branch of our model has some level of impact on the final level of cost-effectiveness irrespective of where the model is being applied.</p>
        <p>The main limitation of this study is the lack of data in current literature on DDH screening attendance rates, compliance rates and drop-out rates in Pakistan and middle-income countries in general. The use of proxies such as clubfoot and deafness screening data made this analysis possible, however, it is impossible to assess how appropriate these are as proxies for DDH screening. Additionally, the wide variety of reported prevalence rates and sensitivity and specificity rates for different screening modalities generate a non-negligible level of uncertainty in the model. Last but not least, our model considers only costs incurred at the level of the hospital/health system and assumes that trained personnel and material are available. It does not include direct and indirect costs incurred by the patient and their families.</p>
        <p>Our results indicate that universal US screening would be the ideal screening method for DDH at IHHN and may be used to inform other similar studies or programmes globally. It should be cautioned that while these options may be the best DDH screening programmes for the IHHN in Karachi at this time, it may not be the best scenario for other cities or provinces in Pakistan. Resource availability, geography, infrastructure, treatment capacity, health system values and societal factors must all be considered when determining which screening protocol may be the best fit in other areas. The presence of personnel and a sufficient budget alone are not enough to determine availability, personnel must be able to administer the tests with adequate skills without being constrained by administrative or licensing regulations.</p>
