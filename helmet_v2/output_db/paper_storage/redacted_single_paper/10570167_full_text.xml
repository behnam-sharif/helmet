        <title>Introduction</title>
        <p id="Par6">Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract that occurs in temperate climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The infection is spread from one host to another via droplet, aerosol, and contact transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Influenza causes symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, and difficulty in breathing. While most people recover within a few days, influenza can lead to serious complications. These include complications related to the respiratory tract, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or acute upper respiratory tract infections, and also cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Certain groups such as children, elderly individuals, and those with pre-existing medical conditions are especially prone to complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to estimates, influenza results in up to 5 million severe cases and up to 646,000 respiratory deaths annually across the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par7">In addition, influenza is also associated with a substantial economic burden, from both payer and societal perspectives. A retrospective analysis of the 2012/13 influenza season in Germany found that costs for hospitalization and outpatient care amounted to more than €100 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. International evidence shows that accounting also for indirect costs leads to much higher estimates, which is mainly due to lost productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par8">Vaccines against influenza have been available for almost 80 years and are regarded as the most effective means of preventing infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As different virus variations circulate in each season, vaccines must be individually adapted to the anticipated virus variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination at the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO) recommends an annual vaccination against seasonal influenza for individuals at risk, including persons aged 60 years and over, individuals with underlying chronic diseases, residents of nursing homes, healthcare workers, and pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For these population subgroups, annual influenza vaccination is covered by the statutory health insurance (SHI). Data on vaccination uptake in Germany for the 2019/20 season show that 38.8% of people aged 60 years and over and 32.3% of persons aged 18 years and over with underlying chronic diseases are vaccinated against influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thus, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) target of a coverage of ≥ 75% in at-risk populations, which was formulated in 2003, is currently not achieved in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par9">Since 2017, the STIKO has recommended the exclusive use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, which contain antigens of two A strains and two B strains and thus could achieve an improved match with circulating influenza viruses compared with trivalent vaccines, which contain only one B strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines is influenced by age, immune competence, and a history of influenza infection, among other factors.</p>
        <p id="Par10">According to the 2021 recommendation of the STIKO, persons insured by the SHI aged 60 years and over should receive an inactivated, quadrivalent high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD), instead of a quadrivalent standard-dose influenza vaccine (IIV4-SD). The clinical and economic effects of this advice are outlined in the bulletin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The recommendation of IIV4-HD is based on a number of trials comparing the relative vaccine efficacy and relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose influenza vaccines (IIV-HD) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV-SD). The rVE is a common metric used to compare two vaccines in their efficacy or effectiveness regarding different endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par11">For example, a randomized controlled trial studied the endpoint laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness and found an rVE of 24.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.7–36.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of IIV-HD compared with IIV-SD. Recently, Lee et al. meta-analyzed 15 publications providing data on more than 22 million individuals receiving IIV-HD and found an rVE of 15.9% of IIV-HD compared to IIV-SD against influenza-like illness (95% CI 4.1–26.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Currently, only one single IIV4-HD vaccine is approved and marketed in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par12">The objective of this study was to investigate the budgetary impact of vaccinating the German population aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD compared to IIV4-SD. Given the commercialization of new vaccines, in conjunction with the public health relevance and high annual costs of seasonal influenza, the results of such cost analyses are highly relevant to policy makers.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p id="Par13">A transmission model was built in Microsoft Excel<sup>®</sup> to model the course of influenza infection in the German population. In order to analyze the economic consequences of the STIKO recommendation to vaccinate people aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD, a budget impact model incorporating the results of the transmission model was developed in Microsoft Excel<sup>®</sup> comparing different scenarios: in scenario A, persons are vaccinated with IIV4-SD and in scenario B, individuals aged 60 years and over received IIV4-HD while persons aged &lt; 60 years still received IIV4-SD. Further scenarios were calculated and are described in detail below. Input parameters were sourced from national and international literature. Additional information on and input parameters of the transmission model and the budget impact model can be found in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).</p>
        <sec id="Sec4">
          <title>Transmission Model</title>
          <p id="Par14">Using an age-stratified deterministic compartment model (SEIR model) with ordinary differential equations, the 2019/2020 influenza season was simulated. This season was selected because of the good availability of data and the negligible impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on input factors. Modeling was performed according to the mass action principle with a cycle length of 1 day, starting on 1 September, 2019 and ending on 22 June, 2020. The German population from December 2019 (83.2 million individuals) was included and stratified into 86 age classes of 1 year each (0–85 years), with the highest age class covering all persons aged 85 years and older. Over time, susceptible individuals (S) are likely to become infected (E) with one of the four circulating influenza strains, then become infectious (I) and recover (R) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of the SEIR model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40273_2023_1299_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
          <p id="Par15">The pre-infectious period was assumed to last 1 day and the infectious period was assumed to last 4.8 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Once recovered from infection, immunity was assumed for the remaining season. The model was run separately for each influenza strain. Of note, death due to influenza is accounted for in the budget impact model. We considered life-years gained in comparison to scenario A by accounting for sex-specific and age-specific life expectancy.</p>
          <sec id="Sec5">
            <title>Susceptibility</title>
            <p id="Par16">The age-specific susceptible fraction of the population was estimated based on the prevalence of antibodies against influenza A and B virus in children and adults aged up to 65 years as reported by Sauerbrei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Susceptibilities for persons aged older than 65 years were assumed to be equal to susceptibilities of persons aged 65 years. The proportions of individuals actually infected with each strain during the season 2019/20 were used to calculate the strain-specific susceptibility. Mainly viruses of the two influenza A subtypes, A(H3N2) (45%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (41%), circulated during the season 2019/20. In addition, 14% of influenza viruses were attributed to the B lineage Victoria in 2019/20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="Sec6">
            <title>Force of Infection</title>
            <p id="Par17">The force of infection is a dynamic parameter that, based on age-specific contact behavior and the number of infected persons, determines how many of the susceptible persons become newly infected, i.e., move from S to E. Contact behavior was sourced from the age-stratified contact matrix of physical contacts for the German population obtained in the POLYMOD study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In brief, Mossong et al. conducted a population-based survey of daily contacts, resulting in a matrix of mixing patterns between individuals of different or similar ages. The next generation matrix was calculated and the dominant eigenvalue was derived from the next generation matrix. Based on a conservative basic reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> of 1.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a matrix of effective contacts was then calculated. Furthermore, an outside infection rate of 1 per 1000 person-years was assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], representing infections brought in from outside the country.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="Sec7">
            <title>Vaccine Coverage</title>
            <p id="Par18">In the SEIR model, we considered two arms: the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. The vaccination coverage is used to select the model population into one of the two arms. According to the 17 regional Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the vaccination rate in Germany for people aged 60 years and over in the 2019/2020 season was 38.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the population younger than 60 years of age, the STIKO recommends an influenza vaccination for at-risk groups. The availability of data on vaccination coverage for individuals aged &lt; 60 years is limited. Accordingly, only historical data from seasons 2004/05 to 2013/14 were accessible. Vaccination rates from the season 2013/14 were used in the model for people aged &lt; 60 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
            <p id="Par19">In separate analyses, scenarios A and B were replicated, assuming a higher vaccination coverage of 75% for the population aged 60 years and older. These analyses are oriented towards the WHO recommendation for increasing vaccination coverage among at-risk individuals. The vaccination rates in the younger population were not changed because of uncertainties about the size of the at-risk population. As vaccination does not provide complete protection against the disease, i.e., vaccination is not 100% effective, there are also susceptible individuals among the vaccinated individuals.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="Sec8">
            <title>Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness</title>
            <p id="Par20">Whereas vaccine efficacy describes the difference in well-defined endpoints (e.g., infections, disease) between a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated group under controlled clinical trial conditions, vaccine effectiveness describes how well a vaccine reduces the risk of infection and disease among vaccinated individuals in a much larger and variable population under real-world conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The rVE compares two vaccines in their efficacy or effectiveness. However, “rVE” is not differentiated well in the literature and often a mix of both, for example called “relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness” or “relative VE” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In fact, there is uncertainty about the difference between vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness in the perception of physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
            <p id="Par21">In the base-case analysis, vaccine effectiveness data for the 2019/2020 season were used for IIV4-SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further, an rVE of 15.9% was assumed for IIV4-HD based on a recently published meta-analysis that reviewed the rVE of trivalent high-dose influenza vaccines (IIV3-HD) in comparison to IIV-SD in persons aged 65 years and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Of note, it is expected that the rVE between IIV4-HD and IIV4-SD in persons aged 60 years and over may be similar to the rVE of IIV3-HD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In a separate analysis, an rVE of 24.2% was assumed.

In the case of an effective antiviral treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], recovery was assumed. Complications can occur in people with ineffective or no antiviral treatment. We considered the following ten complications: bronchitis, acute upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, tonsillitis, laryngitis, pneumonia, otitis media, cardiovascular disorder, cerebrovascular disorder, and neurological disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Complications are either treated in hospital or in the outpatient sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For a proportion of the symptomatic people who do not seek medical help, use of over-the-counter medicine was assumed in the societal perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Influenza-related mortality was considered in individuals that received hospital treatment for complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the societal perspective, working days lost because of influenza were set to 3.3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainties in input parameters in both models, by varying one of the following parameters at a time: susceptibility, basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub>, the costs of IIV4-HD, the costs of IIV-SD, the fraction of symptomatic persons who seek medical help, the fraction of persons having complications, the probability of hospital admission after complication, the fraction of infected persons who become symptomatic, and the costs of general practitioner consultations.

Running the transmission model for the different strains and assuming an exclusive use of IIV4-SD (scenario A, base case) results in a total of 29,116,397 influenza infections on a societal level for the entire German population. Scenario B, in which individuals aged 60 years and over receive IIV4-HD, yields a total of 28,800,860 infections.

Assuming an rVE of IIV4-HD of 24.2% instead of 15.9% (scenario C) would result in 28,637,930 infections, thus translating into 478,467 prevented infections (− 1.6%) with respect to scenario A. Increasing vaccination coverage to 75% in the population aged 60 years and over results in a total of 27,331,657 infections with IIV4-SD (scenario D) and 26,780,986 infections with IIV4-HD (scenario E).

In brief, the deterministic sensitivity analysis shows that variations in costs for IIV4-HD and IIV4-SD have the highest influence on the incremental cost difference between scenario A and scenario B.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Results of deterministic sensitivity analyses. <italic>compl</italic> complications, <italic>GP</italic> general practitioner, <italic>IIV4-HD</italic> quadrivalent high-dose influenza vaccine, <italic>IIV4-SD</italic> quadrivalent standard-dose influenza vaccine, <italic>Prob</italic> probability, <italic>rVE</italic> relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, <italic>Sympt</italic> symptomatic</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40273_2023_1299_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p id="Par36">The modeling approach offers important insights into the nationwide budgetary impact of different vaccination scenarios. In the base case, results for the SHI population show that vaccination of persons aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD instead of IIV4-SD results in higher overall direct costs of €224 million (+ 40.1%) and prevents 277,026 influenza infections (− 1.1%). Assuming an rVE of 24.2% (scenario C), total costs are €218 million (+ 39.1%) higher and 420,063 influenza infections (− 1.7%) are prevented with IIV4-HD compared with IIV4-SD.</p>
        <p id="Par37">The base-case calculation incorporates the actual 2019 influenza vaccination coverage of 38.8% for the elderly population. There is a need to improve vaccination coverage in Germany, as the vaccination rate of elderly individuals and the younger at-risk population is currently below the WHO-recommended rate of ≥ 75%. Although the most recent numbers on influenza vaccination coverage from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show an improvement in coverage among the population aged 65 years and over in 2020, numbers are still lower than in other countries. In 2020, a coverage of 47.3% was reported for Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], with this increase being most probably an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and thus it remains unclear whether this level can be maintained. Other countries such as the UK, Denmark, and Korea achieved vaccination rates of 70% and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In order to determine how much an increase in the vaccination rates would affect infection rates and costs, we conducted separate analyses. Our results show that, compared with the base-case scenario with IIV4-HD (scenario B), a higher vaccination coverage oriented towards the WHO goal in individuals aged 60 years and over can be obtained with IIV4-SD (scenario D) at lower costs from the SHI perspective of €−103 million (− 13.2%) along with a reduction of 1,289,648 influenza infections (− 5.1%). While caveating that this calculation does not include the additional cost of campaigns to increase vaccination coverage, it appears worthwhile to aim for increased vaccination coverage among elderly individuals, given the high number of reduced infections alone. Other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries showed significant increases in vaccination rates in 2020 compared with the previous year. For example, Spain increased its vaccination rate among elderly individuals by 11 percentage points, from 55 to 66%, and Greece even managed a 16 percentage-point increase, from 59 to 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It therefore seems possible to increase the vaccination rate within short periods of time, and projects such as the currently running ALIVE can possibly help to achieve this in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this is of increased clinical relevance. As measures to contain COVID-19 have been reduced in many countries, it can be expected that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 circulates with other respiratory viruses such as influenza, which increases the probability of co-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A recently published meta-analysis found that influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 co-infections are associated with an increased risk of admission to an intensive care unit (odds ratio 2.09, 95% CI 1.64–2.68) and mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.10–4.85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
        <p id="Par38">Our modeling approach, consisting of a transmission model and a subsequent budget impact model, has some limitations. First of all, the transmission dynamics incorporated by our model are based on age-dependent contact patterns only and thus rely on simplifying assumptions. The effective contacts were derived from a study on social contacts and mixing patterns that was published in 2008 and it is unclear whether contact behavior in the particular season we examined is consistent with these data. Another apparent limitation is that only the influenza season 2019/2020 was considered. However, it is the most recent season with a neglectable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on the input parameters, as input data used in the models were obtained before pandemic containment measures (e.g., lockdowns) were initiated. Furthermore, a good data basis regarding the effectiveness of vaccines against the four different strains was given.</p>
        <p id="Par39">The observation of one season only represents a potential weakness and must be taken into account as a limitation when considering the results. As our model did not consider long-term developments of more than one season, any cross-protection between different strains has not been accounted for. As described above, uncertainties exist with regard to the definition of rVE and because of the extrapolation of data from trivalent to quadrivalent vaccines. These were addressed by performing the analysis with different rVEs and by considering parameter changes in the deterministic sensitivity analysis.</p>
        <p id="Par40">Apart from the input data, where the influence of COVID-19 is negligible, it cannot be ruled out that the results of the modeling deviate from the actually observed figures. This is due to the mentioned uncertainties related to the input data; however, we are confident that the observed results are robust for changes, as was shown in the sensitivity analyses.</p>
        <p id="Par41">Another weakness arises from the non-availability of recent population-wide data on influenza infection incidence and prevalence in Germany. As a consequence, our model was calibrated using data on the distribution of susceptible individuals from a previous period and susceptibility for elderly individuals had to be estimated. We agree with Cai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] that the collection of population-level incidence data would reduce the uncertainty of such models. Another potential limitation arises from the non-availability of recent data on vaccination coverage. As a result, only historical data for people younger than 60 years of age and data of regional Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians for individuals aged 60 years and over could be implemented in the model. As influenza vaccinations in Germany are also administered at workplaces, it might be possible that the vaccination rate has been underestimated.</p>
        <p id="Par42">Nevertheless, a comparison with the results of the analysis of the epidemiological bulletin, in which average results over ten seasons are reported, suggests that our results are within a plausible range. Our model results are in-line with the total number of infections, number of symptomatic cases, and number of general practitioner consultations. Of note, in our analysis, the number of fatal cases is slightly lower than the number reported in the bulletin (−9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our model incorporates a higher infection incidence for children, which is a main epidemiological feature of influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. At the same time, older people in particular are prone to a high risk of complications. A recently published cost-of-illness study analyzed influenza-associated hospitalizations based on inpatient data for 10 consecutive years. The authors found a high proportion of individuals aged 59 years and over, which made up more than 50% of all hospitalized cases for the seasons from 2017 onward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Considering limited comparability, as only laboratory-confirmed cases were considered in this analysis, we come to similar results. In our analyses, around 70% of hospitalizations can be attributed to individuals aged 59 years and over. Around 90% of influenza-related fatal cases occur in individuals over the age of 60 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Confirming this figure, 86% of influenza-related deaths in our analysis occurred in persons aged older than 60 years. To conclude, our calculation represents an example of a specific season and has to be regarded as a snapshot. Extrapolations to subsequent seasons are difficult owing to altered input variables, such as changes in vaccination coverage and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on contact behavior. Some of these issues were addressed in the sensitivity analyses.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p id="Par43">The modeling approach presented here offers important insights into the epidemiological and budgetary impact of different vaccination scenarios. We found that achieving a higher vaccination coverage with IIV4-SD in persons aged 60 years and over would result in lower costs and fewer influenza infections compared with the scenario with IIV4-HD and actual vaccination rates.</p>
