    "abstract": "- Background: Evidence on the efficacy of psychological interventions targeting cancer patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD\u2010program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). Methods: Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a059) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD\u2010program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1\u20134 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health\u2010related quality of life (EORTC QLQ\u2010C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6\u00a0months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD\u2010program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD\u2010program. Results: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a033) decreased over time (M\u00a0=\u00a019.2 at T0, M\u00a0=\u00a015.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n\u00a0=\u00a026, M\u00a0=\u00a017.5 at T0, M\u00a0=\u00a015.9 at T6, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD\u2010program was estimated at 7\u201328 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). Conclusions: The effect of the AD\u2010program was not statistically significant in this RCT. Limitations include that this study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. More research on the efficacy and implementation of the AD\u2010program is warranted. Trial Registration: Netherlands Trial Register identifier: NL7763. Registered on 3 June 2019",
