6149200,Doble B,Health-related quality of life impact of minor and major bleeding events during dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic literature review and patient preference elicitation study,Health Qual Life Outcomes,2018,"- Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the recommended preventative treatment for secondary ischaemic events, but increases the risk of bleeding, potentially affecting patients’ health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). Varied utility decrements have been used in cost-effectiveness models assessing alternative DAPT regimens, but it is unclear which of these decrements are most appropriate. Therefore, we reviewed existing sources of utility decrements for bleeds in patients receiving DAPT and undertook primary research to estimate utility decrements through a patient elicitation exercise using vignettes and the EuroQol EQ-5D. Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed and references of included studies were searched. Primary research and decision analytic modelling studies reporting utility decrements for bleeds related to DAPT were considered. For the primary research study, 21 participants completed an elicitation exercise involving vignettes describing minor and major bleeds and the EQ-5D-3 L and EQ-5D-5 L. Utility decrements were derived using linear regression and compared to existing estimates. Results: Four hundred forty-two citations were screened, of which 12 studies were included for review. Reported utility decrements ranged from − 0.002 to − 0.03 for minor bleeds and − 0.007 to − 0.05 for major bleeds. Data sources used to estimate the decrements, however, lacked relevance to our population group and few studies adequately reported details of their measurement and valuation approaches. No study completely adhered to reimbursement agency requirements in the UK according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Our primary research elicited utility decrements overlapped existing estimates, ranging from − 0.000848 to − 0.00828 for minor bleeds and − 0.0187 to − 0.0621 for major bleeds. However, the magnitude of difference depended on the instrument, estimation method and valuation approach applied. Conclusions: Several sources of utility decrements for bleeds are available for use in cost-effectiveness analyses, but are of limited quality and relevance. Our elicitation exercise has derived utility decrements from a relevant patient population, based on standardised definitions of minor and major bleeding events, using a validated HRQoL instrument and have been valued using general population tariffs. We suggest that our utility decrements be used in future cost-effectiveness analyses of DAPT.

10333156,Lin YS,A Simple Cost-Effectiveness Model of Screening: An Open-Source Teaching and Research Tool Coded in R,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- Applied cost-effectiveness analysis models are an important tool for assessing health and economic effects of healthcare interventions but are not best suited for illustrating methods. Our objective is to provide a simple, open-source model for the simulation of disease-screening cost-effectiveness for teaching and research purposes. We introduce our model and provide an initial application to examine changes to the efficiency frontier as input parameters vary and to demonstrate face validity. We described a vectorised, discrete-event simulation of screening in R with an Excel interface to define parameters and inspect principal results. An R Shiny app permits dynamic interpretation of simulation outputs. An example with 8161 screening strategies illustrates the cost and effectiveness of varying the disease sojourn time, treatment effectiveness, and test performance characteristics and costs on screening policies. Many of our findings are intuitive and straightforward, such as a reduction in screening costs leading to decreased overall costs and improved cost-effectiveness. Others are less obvious and depend on whether we consider gross outcomes or those net to no screening. For instance, enhanced treatment of symptomatic disease increases gross effectiveness, but reduces the net effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening. A lengthening of the preclinical sojourn time has ambiguous effects relative to no screening, as cost-effectiveness improves for some strategies but deteriorates for others. Our simple model offers an accessible platform for methods research and teaching. We hope it will serve as a public good and promote an intuitive understanding of the cost-effectiveness of screening.",cem
10455716,Sangeetha G,A Cost-effectiveness Model Comparing Urinary Biomarkers with Diuretic Renogram in Diagnosing Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction in Children,J Indian Assoc Pediatr Surg,2023,"- Background and Aims:: In this cost-effectiveness model, we compared the cost-effectiveness of commonly used urinary biomarkers with conventional diuretic renogram (DR) in diagnosing ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). We hypothesized that urinary biomarkers are as effective as DR. Methods:: We used incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as a tool for our cost-effectiveness analysis model. The cost of biomarker assay and renogram were sourced from the same center while the accuracy data of DR and urinary biomarkers from the relevant pubications. Results:: As the accuracy of individual biomarker increased, the ICER also got better. As a panel of biomarker was introduced, the ICER went to the negative range suggesting cost saving as well. ICER of most urine biomarkers is currently less expensive and less effective. When a biomarker panel was applied ICER became more expensive and effective. With higher samples, test running cost is likely to go down in future and thus biomarkers are likely become less expensive and more effective. Conclusions:: Individual urine biomarkers are currently less expensive and less effective compared to DR in predicting UPJO. In future, biomarker panel is likely to be more cost-effective and reduce the need for invasive renogram thus reducing the radiation exposure.",cem
10635953,Gal P,De Novo Cost-Effectiveness Model Framework for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis—Modeling Approach and Validation,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease associated with hepatic morbidity and mortality and extra-hepatic comorbidities. Published NASH cost-effectiveness models (CEMs) are heterogeneous and consistently omit comorbid conditions that frequently co-exist alongside NASH. We aimed to develop a de novo CEM framework that incorporates extra-hepatic disease states and outcomes alongside hepatic components to enable future estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions. Methods: Patient-level simulation and cohort-level Markov models were implemented in the same framework. Model inputs included fibrosis progression; late-stage liver disease outcomes; comorbidity outcomes for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; mortality; health-related quality of life; and direct medical costs. The prototype analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid versus standard of care from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon with costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. However, the CEM was designed for easy adaptation to other countries, time horizons, and other considerations. Efficacy and adverse event parameters were obtained from the 18-month interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial. Outputs include total and incremental costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years. Results: In this model, total costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years were all higher with obeticholic acid compared with standard of care. Cross-validation of this model with the 2016 and 2020 Institute for Clinical and Economic Review models revealed marked differences, mainly driven by mortality inputs, transition probability estimates, and incorporation of the effect of treatment and comorbidities. Conclusion: This is the first CEM in NASH to incorporate the clinical consequences of several comorbidities. The flexible yet standardized framework permits estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions in a variety of settings. The model currently includes several assumptions and will be further developed as more relevant data become available.

10760782,Abraham K,Benefits of a digital health technology for older nursing home residents. A de-novo cost-effectiveness model for digital health technologies to aid in the assessment of toileting and containment care needs,PLoS One,2024,"- The aim of this study was first, to introduce a comprehensive, de-novo health economic (HE) model incorporating the full range of activities involved in toileting and containment care (T&CC) for people with incontinence, capturing all the potential benefits and costs of existing and future Digital Health Technologies (DHT) aimed at improving continence care, for both residential care and home care. Second, to use this novel model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the DHT TENA SmartCare Identifi in the implementation of person-centred continence care (PCCC), compared with conventional continence care for Canadian nursing home residents. The de-novo HE model was designed to evaluate technologies across different care settings from the perspective of several stakeholders. Health states were based on six care need profiles with increasing need for toileting assistance, three care stages with varying degrees of toileting success, and five levels of skin health. The main outcomes were incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years. The effectiveness of the TENA SmartCare Identifi was based primarily on trial data combined with literature and expert opinion where necessary. Costs were reported in CAD 2020. After 2 years, 21% of residents in the DHT group received mainly toileting as their continence care strategy compared with 12% in the conventional care group. Conversely, with the DHT 15% of residents rely mainly on absorbent products for incontinence care, compared with 40% with conventional care. On average, residents lived for 2.34 years, during which the DHT resulted in a small gain in quality-adjusted life years of 0.015 and overall cost-savings of $1,467 per resident compared with conventional care. Most cost-savings were achieved through reduced costs for absorbent products. Since most, if not all, stakeholders gain from use of the DHT-assisted PCCC, widespread use in Canadian residential care facilities should be considered, and similar assessments for other countries encouraged.",cem
10948140,Paoli CJ,Effectiveness of Single-Tablet Combination Therapy in Improving Adherence and Persistence and the Relation to Clinical and Economic Outcomes,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2024,"- Background: Single-tablet combination therapies (STCTs) combine multiple drugs into one formulation, making drug administration more convenient for patients. STCTs were developed to address concerns with treatment adherence and persistence, but the impact of STCT use is not fully understood across indications.Objectives: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine STCT-associated outcomes across 4 evidence domains: clinical trials, real-world evidence (RWE), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) studies, and economic evaluations.Methods: Four SLRs were conducted across the aforementioned domains. Included studies compared STCTs as well as fixed-dose combinations ([FDCs] of non-tablet formulations) with the equivalent active compounds and doses in loose-dose combinations (LDCs). Original research articles were included; case reports, case series, and non-English-language sources were excluded. Databases searched included EconLit, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE® ALL. Two independent reviewers assessed relevant studies and extracted data. Conflicts were resolved with a third reviewer or consensus-based discussion.Results: In all, 109 studies were identified; 27 studies were identified in more than one SLR. Treatment adherence was significantly higher in patients receiving FDCs vs LDCs in 12 of 13 RWE studies and 3 of 13 clinical trials. All 18 RWE studies reported higher persistence with FDCs. In RWE studies examining clinical outcomes (n = 17), 14 reported positive findings with FDCs, including a reduced need for add-on medication, blood pressure control, and improved hemoglobin A1C. HRQoL studies generally reported numerical improvements with STCTs or similarities between STCTs and LDCs. Economic outcomes favored STCT use. All 6 cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses found FDCs were less expensive and more efficacious than LDCs. Four budget impact models found that STCTs were associated with cost savings. Medical costs and healthcare resource use were generally lower with FDCs than with LDCs.Discussion: Evidence from RWE and economic studies strongly favored STCT use, while clinical trials and HRQoL studies primarily reported similarity between STCTs and LDCs. This may be due to clinical trial procedures aimed at maximizing adherence and HRQoL measures that are not designed to evaluate drug administration.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the value of STCTs for improving patient adherence, persistence, and clinical outcomes while also offering economic advantages.",slr_bim
11136791,Paulissen JH,Cost-effectiveness model of trastuzumab deruxtecan as second-line treatment in HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in Finland,Eur J Health Econ,2023,"- Objectives: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was recently recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use as a treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who had received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. In our study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd compared with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for this indication in Finland. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival analysis model was developed with a payer’s perspective. Time to event data from the DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03) trial were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon either directly—for progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation—or using an alternative approach utilizing long-term T-DM1 survival data and DB-03 data—for overall survival. Discount rates of 3% were applied for costs and effects. Inputs were sourced from the Medicinal Products Database from Kela, Helsinki University Hospital service price list, Finnish Medicines Agency assessments, clinical experts, and DB-03. Sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize and demonstrate parameter uncertainties in the model. Results: Total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) gained for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were 1.93 and 2.56, respectively. Incremental costs for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were €106,800, resulting in an ICER of €55,360 per QALY gained and an ICER of €41,775 per LY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the hazard ratio of T-DXd vs T-DM1 for OS was the most influential parameter. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed similar results to the base case. Conclusions: T-DXd is cost-effective based on surrogate WTP thresholds of €72,000 and €139,000 per QALY.

11178649,Wright SJ,A structured process for the validation of a decision-analytic model: application to a cost-effectiveness model for risk-stratified national breast screening,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,2024,"- Background: Decision-makers require knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of decision-analytic models used to evaluate healthcare interventions to be able to confidently use the results of such models to inform policy. A number of aspects of model validity have previously been described, but no systematic approach to assessing the validity of a model has been proposed. This study aimed to consolidate the different aspects of model validity into a step-by-step approach to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a decision-analytic model. Methods: A pre-defined set of steps were used to conduct the validation process of an exemplar early decision-analytic-model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programme [UK healthcare perspective; lifetime horizon; costs (£; 2021)]. Internal validation was assessed in terms of descriptive validity, technical validity and face validity. External validation was assessed in terms of operational validation, convergent validity (or corroboration) and predictive validity. Results: The results outline the findings of each step of internal and external validation of the early decision-analytic-model and present the validated model (called ‘MANC-RISK-SCREEN’). The positive aspects in terms of meeting internal validation requirements are shown together with the remaining limitations of MANC-RISK-SCREEN. Conclusion: Following a transparent and structured validation process, MANC-RISK-SCREEN has been shown to have satisfactory internal and external validity for use in informing resource allocation decision-making. We suggest that MANC-RISK-SCREEN can be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of exemplars of risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programmes (NBSP) from the UK perspective. Implications: A step-by-step process for conducting the validation of a decision-analytic model was developed for future use by health economists. Using this approach may help researchers to fully demonstrate the strengths and limitations of their model to decision-makers.

11366214,Willis M,Budget impact models for lung cancer interventions: A systematic literature review,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2024,"- BACKGROUND:: Budget impact models (BIMs) forecast the financial implications of adopting new technologies and the potential need for budget reallocation, thus playing a crucial role in reimbursement decisions. Despite the importance of accurate forecasts, studies indicate large discrepancies between estimates and reality. We are developing an artificial intelligence–based clinical decision tool to identify patients with non–small cell lung cancer who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the budgetary implications and describe a systematic literature review of published lung cancer BIMs. METHODS:: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published between 2010 and 2023 that include BIMs that describe lung cancer interventions. Forward and backward reference searches were performed for all qualifying studies. We extracted author and publication year, country, interventions, disease stages, time horizon, analytical perspective, modeling methods used, types of costs included, sensitivity analyses conducted, and data sources used. We then evaluated adherence to the Professional Society for Health Economics and Pharmacoeconomics Research best-practice guidelines. RESULTS:: A total of 25 BIMs were identified, spanning 14 different countries. Model structure could not be ascertained definitively for nearly half of the models. The cost calculator approach was most common among the others. Time horizons ranged from 1 to 5 years, in line with recommendations. Most models compared drugs, 4 compared nondrug interventions, and 7 compared diagnostic technologies. Assumptions about market uptake were poorly documented and poorly motivated. Inclusion of cancer-related costs was rare. Adherence to best practices was variable and did not appear to improve over time. CONCLUSIONS:: The number of published BIMs for lung cancer exceeded expectations. There were modest trends toward publication frequency and model quality over time. Our analysis revealed variability across the models, as well as their adherence to best practices, indicating substantial room for improvement. Although none of the models were individually suitable for the purpose of evaluating an artificial intelligence–based treatment selection tool, some models provided valuable insights.",slr_bim
11812765,Pigeolet M,"Cost-effectiveness of screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip in Karachi, Pakistan using a universally applicable cost-effectiveness model",BMJ Public Health,2024,"- Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital anomaly of the hip socket that can lead to lifelong disability and pain when left untreated. DDH is a good candidate for screening because of its high frequency in population, availability of treatment and the possibility of secondary prevention. Pakistan currently does not have any systematic or universal neonatal screening programme for DDH. Methods: The cost-effectiveness model in this study uses one decision tree for each screening scenario: (1) the status quo, (2) universal screening by clinical examination, (3) universal screening by clinical examination with targeted ultrasound (US) screening, (4) and universal screening by US. Loss of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) is used as outcome variable. Results: When left untreated DDH creates a loss of 3.4 DALYs per person. Clinical examination and targeted US averts most DALYs per dollar spent. Generalised US averts more DALYs overall but requires a greater financial investment per DALY averted. Conclusions: Universal US screening reaches more children and can be considered the more equitable approach but requires 10 times the financial investment clinical examination and targeted US requires. The decision which option is most appropriate for Karachi, Pakistan depends on resource availability, geography, infrastructure, treatment capacity, health system values and societal factors in Pakistan.",cem
11849414,Siegfried C,Using QIP-MS to Guide the Timing of MRD Testing in Patients With Multiple Myeloma: A Budget Impact Analysis From the French Payer Perspective,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- Purpose: Serum or urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP or UPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE or UIFE) are routinely used to detect M-proteins in MM patients. However, SPEP and SIFE are not sensitive enough to measure M-protein levels that are low but still clinically significant. This study aimed to evaluate the potential cost savings associated with using the EXENT GAM Assay, a serum-based quantitative-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (QIP-MS) diagnostic test instead of SIFE to guide the timing of minimal residual disease (MRD) testing for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: A simple 2-year budget impact model was created in Excel using data from MM clinical trials and fee schedules. Patients are tested with either QIP-MS or SIFE at predetermined timepoints. If patients test negative, they will receive MRD testing. The result of the MRD test will determine if the preceding serum-based test was a true negative result (MRD test is negative) or a false negative result (MRD test is positive). Patients receiving autologous stem cell transplant (henceforth referred to as transplant) and those not receiving transplant are both eligible for one MRD test per year. MRD testing for transplant-eligible patients occurs prior to transplant and one year following transplant. Results: Across a hypothetical population of 5154 mm patients receiving 1st-line treatment in France, using QIP-MS instead of SIFE prior to MRD testing leads to 1973 fewer false negative results and 744 more false positive results (due, in part, to the detection of residual IgG). Net savings per QIP-MS test would be €260 or total savings of €2,481,832. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of QIP-MS prior to MRD testing may be cost-saving for testing French patients with MM.",bim
11871816,Goudarzi Z,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of rivaroxaban with or without aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients with coronary and peripheral artery diseases in Iran,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- Background: Low-dose aspirin and rivaroxaban are the cornerstone treatment for cardiovascular prevention in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). The combination of rivaroxaban with aspirin imposes a synergistic effect on the inhibition of factor-induced platelet aggregation. The present work aimed at comparing the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban alone (5 mg twice daily) with aspirin alone in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or coronary artery disease (CAD) and related subgroups. Methods: This pharmacoeconomic study was performed based on the insurance organization and utilized a state-transition decision Markov model. From the COMPASS trial, Clinical efficacy and Clinical events were collected. Health outcomes and cost were assessed over a 20-year time horizon (lifetime). The direct costs of medical services were included in the analysis. The results were stated based on Incremental Cost-Utility (ICUR) and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed utilizing deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Discount rates of .058 and .03 were included for cost and effectiveness data, respectively. The budget impact based on the Markov model was estimated as the financial burden resulting from the insurance coverage of rivaroxaban. Results: In the total of CAD and PAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were more expensive than the aspirin alone, but also more effective, resulting in ICUR being $4594/QALY and $13601/QALY respectively, and for ICER being $3348/LYG and $9901/LYG. In PAD patients rivaroxaban plus aspirin had higher effectiveness than aspirin alone that ICUR and ICER being $11929/QALY and $9896/LYG respectively. In CAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin was expensive and less effective than aspirin alone. The estimated annual budget impact was $28,253,135 for the rivaroxaban plus aspirin and $292,593,909 for the rivaroxaban alone in the total of CAD and PAD patients. Conclusions: This study showed that rivaroxaban plus aspirin is a cost-effective alternative in PAD and total of CAD and PAD patients. In CAD patients, rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were not cost-effective.",bim
11881394,Goudarzi Z,Value of cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment for Lennox Gastaut syndrome: cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,BMC Med,2025,"- Background: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. Methods: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. Results: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated. Conclusions: Compared to usual care, CBD seems to be cost-effective in LGS patients and sustainable, with less than 34% overall budget increased in the next 5 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word setting and in other countries.",bim
11884430,Samacá-Samacá D,Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of the Use of Faricimab in Diabetic Macular Edema and Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Colombia,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Retinal diseases are major contributors to disability, significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) represent a significant disease and economic burden in Colombia. Assessing the economic evaluation of available treatments is essential for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using faricimab for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD within the Colombian health system. Methods: This study used a 25-year Markov cohort model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of faricimab vs aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab. We used the methodological guidelines of the local health technology assessment agency for conducting the cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. Transition probabilities and injection frequencies were derived from the literature. Drug prices were retrieved from public local databases. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. The potential patient population for the budget impact analysis was estimated based on disease prevalence and expert consultations. Results: Faricimab treat-and-extend (T&E) was dominant vs aflibercept T&E (+0.22 QALYs), ranibizumab T&E (+0.55 QALYs), and brolucizumab for 8 to 12 weeks (+0.06 QALYs) in DME, generating cost savings (in US dollars) of 3849,1375, and 2824,respectively.InnAMD,faricimabalsoshoweddominancevsafliberceptasneeded(+0.12Q ALYs),ranibizumabasneeded(+0.05QALYs),andbrolucizumab8to12weeks(+0.12QALYs)withsa vingsin(US)7223, 5792,and6798, respectively.

Conclusion: Considering a willingness to pay threshold of $5988 per additional QALY, faricimab is a cost-effective alternative for both DME and nAMD for the Colombian healthcare system, showing dominance over other anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Faricimab provides better health outcomes at lower costs vs other treatments.",bim
11910135,Holtmaat K,Efficacy and Budget Impact of a Tailored Psychological Intervention Program Targeting Cancer Patients With Adjustment Disorder: A Randomised Controlled Trial,Psychooncology,2025,"- Background: Evidence on the efficacy of psychological interventions targeting cancer patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD‐program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). Methods: Patients (n = 59) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD‐program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1–4 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health‐related quality of life (EORTC QLQ‐C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD‐program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD‐program. Results: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n = 33) decreased over time (M = 19.2 at T0, M = 15.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n = 26, M = 17.5 at T0, M = 15.9 at T6, p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD‐program was estimated at 7–28 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). Conclusions: The effect of the AD‐program was not statistically significant in this RCT. Limitations include that this study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties during the COVID‐19 pandemic. More research on the efficacy and implementation of the AD‐program is warranted.

The target population consisted of Type 2 diabetic patients with comorbid depression who were nonadherent to their pharmacological treatment.Method: The average cost per controlled patient (glycated hemoglobin < 7%) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Similarly, the budgetary impact over 1 year of implementing this program in the region of reference of the randomized clinical trial was assessed.Results: The number of controlled patients is higher in the TELE-DD group at 6, 12, and 18 months. The average cost per controlled patient was higher in the TELE-DD group than in the control group at 6 months (€160.31 vs. €49.79), but lower at 12 (€150.09 vs. €179.59) and 18 months (€209.22 vs. €376.88). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 6, 12, and 18 months was €254.47, €143.65, and €177.46, respectively. The budget impact analysis revealed that implementing the TELE-DD program would result in a reduction of €721,940.68 in expenditure for the funder in the first year of application.Conclusions: A nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression is an efficient option in the management of healthcare resources. These results highlight the role of nursing in chronic patient management and the efficient use of healthcare resources.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04097483.",bim
11922778,Modi B,The Budget Impact of Cangrelor in the UK for the Treatment of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Who Require Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Cangrelor is an intravenous, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure, and in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable (for example, in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [OHCA] population). Objective: This study aimed to estimate the affordability and budget impact, in the United Kingdom, of introducing cangrelor within the licenced OHCA population. Methods: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of introducing cangrelor to hospitals over 5 years. Efficacy (thrombotic events) and safety (bleeding events) data were based on clinical trials, cost data (2021/22 GBP), literature, NHS reference costs and British National Formulary data. Comparators were glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and aspirin in combination with heparin, reflecting current treatments used in UK centres for the target population. Cangrelor uptake was estimated as 50% in Year 1, 75% in Year 2, and 100% in Years 3–5. The OHCA population was estimated from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society National Audit 2021/22. Results: Over 5 years, cangrelor leads to modelled cost savings of £2,709,853 (−9.84%), varying from £322,218 in Year 1 (−5.85%) to £636,150 (−11.55%) in Year 5). This is driven by approximately 6,882 hospital days being avoided over 5 years due to fewer bleeding events. Conclusion: Cangrelor for OHCA patients who cannot take oral P2Y12 inhibitors may lead to cost savings in the UK.",bim
11927220,Maphanga B,The budget impact analysis of nicotine replacement therapy among patients who smoke tobacco and have mental illness in South Africa and the implications,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- Background: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death, with the highest burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those who have mental illness are particularly vulnerable, with a smoking rate two to five times higher than that of the general population. Quitting smoking has demonstrated benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving the quality of life. However, the economic feasibility of introducing Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the psychiatric medical environment in South Africa has not yet been explored. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the impact on the budget of implementing an NRT-based smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital. Methods: This retrospective and cross-sectional study followed a budget impact analysis framework. Data were retrieved between May 19 and Aug 18, 2023, from 214 patients' medical records. Using primary and secondary data, an ingredients costing approach was used to estimate direct treatment costs of NRT smoking cessation. All costs were expressed in ZAR (South African currency). The economic evaluation was conducted from the payer's perspective, and the results were reported at a 5% discount rate. A two-way 10% sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: The study showed that study participants were primarily black, male, unemployed, diagnosed with schizophrenia and smoked lightly (69.16% ±3.46). Implementing the 3-month treatment period of NRT smoking cessation program would result in an expenditure of R1 478 915.42 for 214 patients. The hospital will require an additional 0.15% (±0.0095) of the total hospital budget and 6.09% (±0.31) of the hospital pharmacy budget. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that while implementing a NRT is crucial for improving the overall health outcomes among patients with mental illnesses, substantial investment would be required. The budgetary allocation for NRT smoking cessation interventions would vary by treatment settings and program duration. Consequently, careful consideration of budget allocation and resource distribution is necessary to ensure the program's sustainability within the broader healthcare framework in South Africa.",bim
11936304,McCullough HP,"The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation mHealth Intervention for People Experiencing Homelessness: Cost Analysis, Exploratory Financial Cost-Benefit Analysis, and Budget Impact Analysis",JMIR Form Res,2025,"- Background: The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation (iCAN) mobile health intervention aims to improve care coordination and reduce hospital and emergency department visits among people experiencing homelessness. Objective: This study aimed to conduct a three-part economic evaluation of iCAN, including a (1) cost analysis, (2) exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis, and (3) budget impact analysis (BIA). Methods: We collected cost and expenditure data from a randomized controlled trial of iCAN to conduct a cost analysis and exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis. Costs were classified as startup and recurring costs for participants and the program. Startup costs included participant supplies for each participant and SMS implementation costs. Recurring costs included the cost of recurring services, SMS text messaging platform maintenance, health information access fees, and personnel salaries. Using the per participant per year (PPPY) costs of iCAN, the minimum savings reduction in the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness that would lead to a benefit-cost ratio >1 for iCAN was calculated. This savings threshold was calculated by dividing the PPPY cost of iCAN by the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness multiplied by 100%. The benefit-cost ratio of iCAN was calculated under different savings thresholds from 0% (no savings) to 50%. Costs were calculated PPPY under different scenarios, and the results were used as inputs in a BIA. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate uncertainty around cost estimates. Costs are in 2022 US $. Results: The total cost of iCAN was US $2865 PPPY, which was made up of US $265 in startup (9%) and US $2600 (91%) in recurring costs PPPY. The minimum savings threshold that would cause iCAN to have a positive return on investment is 7.8%. This means that if average health care costs (US $36,917) among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. When health care costs are reduced by 25% ($9229/$36,917; equal to 56% [$9229/$16,609] of the average cost of an inpatient visit), the benefit-cost ratio is 3.22, which means that iCAN produces US $2.22 in health care savings per US $1 spent. The BIA estimated that implementing iCAN for 10,250 people experiencing homelessness over 5 years would have a financial cost of US $28.7 million, which could be reduced to US $2.2 million if at least 8% ($2880/$36,917) of average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness are reduced through the intervention. Conclusions: If average costs of emergency department and hospital visits among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% ($2880/$36,917) through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. As the savings threshold increases, it results in a higher benefit-cost ratio.",bim
11953859,Shafrin J,Economic impact of sotagliflozin among patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes: Budget impact analysis from the US payer perspective,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2025,"- BACKGROUND:: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States, often complicated by comorbidities like diabetes mellitus. These patients face high hospitalization risks, impacting clinical outcomes and health care resources. The Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that sotagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, reduced rehospitalizations in patients with HF and diabetes mellitus. Although clinically beneficial, the economic impact of sotagliflozin from a payer perspective remains unclear, warranting further pharmacoeconomic analysis to guide managed care decisions. OBJECTIVE:: To quantify the budget impact of sotagliflozin for US payers over a 5-year time horizon. METHODS:: A payer-perspective budget impact model was developed to assess the financial impact of incorporating sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients recently hospitalized for HF with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 5 years to US payer health plans. The study used a population reflecting the SOLOIST-WHF clinical trial, with economic parameters adjusted by payer mix (all payer, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid). Health care resource utilization included hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and adverse events’ care. Economic outcomes examined the medical and pharmacy budget impact for payers at the per-user, per member per month (PMPM), and total plan costs levels. RESULTS:: For a hypothetical 1-million-member all-payer plan, 1,516 patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid T2D would be eligible for sotagliflozin. For all-payer plans, annual per-user costs increased by $4,996 because of higher pharmacy costs ($8,260) but were partially offset by lower medical costs (−$2,608) because of reduced rehospitalization and ED visits from sotagliflozin. PMPM total budget impact of sotagliflozin would be $0.08 PMPM in year 1 and $0.38 in year 5, corresponding with total plan cost of $75,736 in year 1 and $378,681 by year 5. Commercial payer PMPM costs were lower ($0.02 in year 1; $0.11 in year 5), and higher for Medicare ($0.23 PMPM in year 1, increasing to 1.13 PMPM in year 5). Breakeven rebate rates ranged between 31.5% and 79.4%. CONCLUSIONS:: Although sotagliflozin increases pharmacy costs for recently hospitalized HF patients with T2D, approximately 21%-68% of pharmacy costs were offset from reduced rehospitalization and ED visits.",bim
6149200,Doble B,Health-related quality of life impact of minor and major bleeding events during dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic literature review and patient preference elicitation study,Health Qual Life Outcomes,2018,"- Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the recommended preventative treatment for secondary ischaemic events, but increases the risk of bleeding, potentially affecting patients’ health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). Varied utility decrements have been used in cost-effectiveness models assessing alternative DAPT regimens, but it is unclear which of these decrements are most appropriate. Therefore, we reviewed existing sources of utility decrements for bleeds in patients receiving DAPT and undertook primary research to estimate utility decrements through a patient elicitation exercise using vignettes and the EuroQol EQ-5D. Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed and references of included studies were searched. Primary research and decision analytic modelling studies reporting utility decrements for bleeds related to DAPT were considered. For the primary research study, 21 participants completed an elicitation exercise involving vignettes describing minor and major bleeds and the EQ-5D-3 L and EQ-5D-5 L. Utility decrements were derived using linear regression and compared to existing estimates. Results: Four hundred forty-two citations were screened, of which 12 studies were included for review. Reported utility decrements ranged from − 0.002 to − 0.03 for minor bleeds and − 0.007 to − 0.05 for major bleeds. Data sources used to estimate the decrements, however, lacked relevance to our population group and few studies adequately reported details of their measurement and valuation approaches. No study completely adhered to reimbursement agency requirements in the UK according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Our primary research elicited utility decrements overlapped existing estimates, ranging from − 0.000848 to − 0.00828 for minor bleeds and − 0.0187 to − 0.0621 for major bleeds. However, the magnitude of difference depended on the instrument, estimation method and valuation approach applied. Conclusions: Several sources of utility decrements for bleeds are available for use in cost-effectiveness analyses, but are of limited quality and relevance. Our elicitation exercise has derived utility decrements from a relevant patient population, based on standardised definitions of minor and major bleeding events, using a validated HRQoL instrument and have been valued using general population tariffs. We suggest that our utility decrements be used in future cost-effectiveness analyses of DAPT.

8079293,Keeney E,Using a Modified Delphi Approach to Gain Consensus on Relevant Comparators in a Cost-Effectiveness Model: Application to Prostate Cancer Screening,Pharmacoeconomics,2021,"- Objective: Challenges can exist when framing the decision question in a cost-effectiveness analysis, particularly when there is disagreement among experts on relevant comparators. Using prostate cancer screening and recent developments in risk stratification, early-detection biomarkers, and diagnostic technologies as a case study, we report a modified Delphi approach to handle decision-question uncertainty. Methods: The study involved two rounds of anonymous online questionnaires to identify the prostate cancer screening strategies that international researchers, clinicians and decision makers felt important to consider in a cost-effectiveness model. Both purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit experts. The questionnaire was based on a review of the literature and was piloted for language, comprehension and ease of use prior to dissemination. In Round 1, respondents indicated their preferred screening strategy (including no screening) through a series of multiple-choice questions. The responses informed a set of 13 consensus statements, which respondents ranked their agreement with on a 9-point Likert scale (Round 2). Consensus was considered reached if > 70% of participants indicated agreement and < 15% indicated disagreement. Results: Twenty participants completed Round 1 and 17 completed Round 2. Consensus was shown towards comparing no formal screening, age-based, and risk-based strategies. The risk-based approaches included screening only higher-risk men, using shorter screening intervals for higher-risk men, screening higher-risk men at an earlier age, and tailoring screening intervals based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at a previous test. There was agreement that inclusion of MRI in the pathway should be considered, but disagreement on the inclusion of new biomarkers. Conclusion: In disease areas where technologies are rapidly evolving, a modified Delphi approach provides a useful tool to identify relevant comparators in an economic evaluation.

SUBJECTS AND SETTING:: The model was populated with data inputs from a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta. Model results were assessed for robustness via the use of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta were chosen because cost data were readily accessible. The combined population of these provinces accounts for 50% of Canada's population. RESULTS:: An expected cost savings of Can$443.13 (US $322.60) and Can$243.84 (US $177.52) per user for the hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta per year was obtained for those using a CIB versus a non-infused skin barrier in Ontario and Alberta, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CIB to SOC per peristomal skin complication (PSC) avoided and per quality-adjusted life day (QALD) gained was approximately Can$2702 (US $1967)/PSC and Can$1266 (US $922)/QALD for Ontario and approximately Can$1487 (US $1083)/PSC and Can$697 (US $507)/QALD for Alberta. Analysis indicated CIBs remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS:: Finding suggest that a CIB is cost-effective when compared to a barrier not infused with ceramide when applied to persons with an ostomy and residing in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario.",cem
10333156,Lin YS,A Simple Cost-Effectiveness Model of Screening: An Open-Source Teaching and Research Tool Coded in R,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- Applied cost-effectiveness analysis models are an important tool for assessing health and economic effects of healthcare interventions but are not best suited for illustrating methods. Our objective is to provide a simple, open-source model for the simulation of disease-screening cost-effectiveness for teaching and research purposes. We introduce our model and provide an initial application to examine changes to the efficiency frontier as input parameters vary and to demonstrate face validity. We described a vectorised, discrete-event simulation of screening in R with an Excel interface to define parameters and inspect principal results. An R Shiny app permits dynamic interpretation of simulation outputs. An example with 8161 screening strategies illustrates the cost and effectiveness of varying the disease sojourn time, treatment effectiveness, and test performance characteristics and costs on screening policies. Many of our findings are intuitive and straightforward, such as a reduction in screening costs leading to decreased overall costs and improved cost-effectiveness. Others are less obvious and depend on whether we consider gross outcomes or those net to no screening. For instance, enhanced treatment of symptomatic disease increases gross effectiveness, but reduces the net effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening. A lengthening of the preclinical sojourn time has ambiguous effects relative to no screening, as cost-effectiveness improves for some strategies but deteriorates for others. Our simple model offers an accessible platform for methods research and teaching. We hope it will serve as a public good and promote an intuitive understanding of the cost-effectiveness of screening.",cem

We hypothesized that urinary biomarkers are as effective as DR. Methods:: We used incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as a tool for our cost-effectiveness analysis model. The cost of biomarker assay and renogram were sourced from the same center while the accuracy data of DR and urinary biomarkers from the relevant pubications. Results:: As the accuracy of individual biomarker increased, the ICER also got better. As a panel of biomarker was introduced, the ICER went to the negative range suggesting cost saving as well. ICER of most urine biomarkers is currently less expensive and less effective. When a biomarker panel was applied ICER became more expensive and effective. With higher samples, test running cost is likely to go down in future and thus biomarkers are likely become less expensive and more effective. Conclusions:: Individual urine biomarkers are currently less expensive and less effective compared to DR in predicting UPJO. In future, biomarker panel is likely to be more cost-effective and reduce the need for invasive renogram thus reducing the radiation exposure.",cem
10635953,Gal P,De Novo Cost-Effectiveness Model Framework for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis—Modeling Approach and Validation,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease associated with hepatic morbidity and mortality and extra-hepatic comorbidities. Published NASH cost-effectiveness models (CEMs) are heterogeneous and consistently omit comorbid conditions that frequently co-exist alongside NASH. We aimed to develop a de novo CEM framework that incorporates extra-hepatic disease states and outcomes alongside hepatic components to enable future estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions. Methods: Patient-level simulation and cohort-level Markov models were implemented in the same framework. Model inputs included fibrosis progression; late-stage liver disease outcomes; comorbidity outcomes for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; mortality; health-related quality of life; and direct medical costs. The prototype analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid versus standard of care from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon with costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. However, the CEM was designed for easy adaptation to other countries, time horizons, and other considerations. Efficacy and adverse event parameters were obtained from the 18-month interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial. Outputs include total and incremental costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years. Results: In this model, total costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years were all higher with obeticholic acid compared with standard of care. Cross-validation of this model with the 2016 and 2020 Institute for Clinical and Economic Review models revealed marked differences, mainly driven by mortality inputs, transition probability estimates, and incorporation of the effect of treatment and comorbidities. Conclusion: This is the first CEM in NASH to incorporate the clinical consequences of several comorbidities. The flexible yet standardized framework permits estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions in a variety of settings. The model currently includes several assumptions and will be further developed as more relevant data become available.

10760782,Abraham K,Benefits of a digital health technology for older nursing home residents. A de-novo cost-effectiveness model for digital health technologies to aid in the assessment of toileting and containment care needs,PLoS One,2024,"- The aim of this study was first, to introduce a comprehensive, de-novo health economic (HE) model incorporating the full range of activities involved in toileting and containment care (T&CC) for people with incontinence, capturing all the potential benefits and costs of existing and future Digital Health Technologies (DHT) aimed at improving continence care, for both residential care and home care. Second, to use this novel model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the DHT TENA SmartCare Identifi in the implementation of person-centred continence care (PCCC), compared with conventional continence care for Canadian nursing home residents. The de-novo HE model was designed to evaluate technologies across different care settings from the perspective of several stakeholders. Health states were based on six care need profiles with increasing need for toileting assistance, three care stages with varying degrees of toileting success, and five levels of skin health. The main outcomes were incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years. The effectiveness of the TENA SmartCare Identifi was based primarily on trial data combined with literature and expert opinion where necessary. Costs were reported in CAD 2020. After 2 years, 21% of residents in the DHT group received mainly toileting as their continence care strategy compared with 12% in the conventional care group. Conversely, with the DHT 15% of residents rely mainly on absorbent products for incontinence care, compared with 40% with conventional care. On average, residents lived for 2.34 years, during which the DHT resulted in a small gain in quality-adjusted life years of 0.015 and overall cost-savings of $1,467 per resident compared with conventional care. Most cost-savings were achieved through reduced costs for absorbent products. Since most, if not all, stakeholders gain from use of the DHT-assisted PCCC, widespread use in Canadian residential care facilities should be considered, and similar assessments for other countries encouraged.",cem

STCTs were developed to address concerns with treatment adherence and persistence, but the impact of STCT use is not fully understood across indications.Objectives: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine STCT-associated outcomes across 4 evidence domains: clinical trials, real-world evidence (RWE), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) studies, and economic evaluations.Methods: Four SLRs were conducted across the aforementioned domains. Included studies compared STCTs as well as fixed-dose combinations ([FDCs] of non-tablet formulations) with the equivalent active compounds and doses in loose-dose combinations (LDCs). Original research articles were included; case reports, case series, and non-English-language sources were excluded. Databases searched included EconLit, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE® ALL. Two independent reviewers assessed relevant studies and extracted data. Conflicts were resolved with a third reviewer or consensus-based discussion.Results: In all, 109 studies were identified; 27 studies were identified in more than one SLR. Treatment adherence was significantly higher in patients receiving FDCs vs LDCs in 12 of 13 RWE studies and 3 of 13 clinical trials. All 18 RWE studies reported higher persistence with FDCs. In RWE studies examining clinical outcomes (n = 17), 14 reported positive findings with FDCs, including a reduced need for add-on medication, blood pressure control, and improved hemoglobin A1C. HRQoL studies generally reported numerical improvements with STCTs or similarities between STCTs and LDCs. Economic outcomes favored STCT use. All 6 cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses found FDCs were less expensive and more efficacious than LDCs. Four budget impact models found that STCTs were associated with cost savings. Medical costs and healthcare resource use were generally lower with FDCs than with LDCs.Discussion: Evidence from RWE and economic studies strongly favored STCT use, while clinical trials and HRQoL studies primarily reported similarity between STCTs and LDCs. This may be due to clinical trial procedures aimed at maximizing adherence and HRQoL measures that are not designed to evaluate drug administration.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the value of STCTs for improving patient adherence, persistence, and clinical outcomes while also offering economic advantages.",slr_bim
11136791,Paulissen JH,Cost-effectiveness model of trastuzumab deruxtecan as second-line treatment in HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in Finland,Eur J Health Econ,2023,"- Objectives: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was recently recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use as a treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who had received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. In our study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd compared with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for this indication in Finland. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival analysis model was developed with a payer’s perspective. Time to event data from the DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03) trial were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon either directly—for progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation—or using an alternative approach utilizing long-term T-DM1 survival data and DB-03 data—for overall survival. Discount rates of 3% were applied for costs and effects. Inputs were sourced from the Medicinal Products Database from Kela, Helsinki University Hospital service price list, Finnish Medicines Agency assessments, clinical experts, and DB-03. Sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize and demonstrate parameter uncertainties in the model. Results: Total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) gained for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were 1.93 and 2.56, respectively. Incremental costs for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were €106,800, resulting in an ICER of €55,360 per QALY gained and an ICER of €41,775 per LY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the hazard ratio of T-DXd vs T-DM1 for OS was the most influential parameter. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed similar results to the base case. Conclusions: T-DXd is cost-effective based on surrogate WTP thresholds of €72,000 and €139,000 per QALY.

11178649,Wright SJ,A structured process for the validation of a decision-analytic model: application to a cost-effectiveness model for risk-stratified national breast screening,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,2024,"- Background: Decision-makers require knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of decision-analytic models used to evaluate healthcare interventions to be able to confidently use the results of such models to inform policy. A number of aspects of model validity have previously been described, but no systematic approach to assessing the validity of a model has been proposed. This study aimed to consolidate the different aspects of model validity into a step-by-step approach to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a decision-analytic model. Methods: A pre-defined set of steps were used to conduct the validation process of an exemplar early decision-analytic-model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programme [UK healthcare perspective; lifetime horizon; costs (£; 2021)]. Internal validation was assessed in terms of descriptive validity, technical validity and face validity. External validation was assessed in terms of operational validation, convergent validity (or corroboration) and predictive validity. Results: The results outline the findings of each step of internal and external validation of the early decision-analytic-model and present the validated model (called ‘MANC-RISK-SCREEN’). The positive aspects in terms of meeting internal validation requirements are shown together with the remaining limitations of MANC-RISK-SCREEN. Conclusion: Following a transparent and structured validation process, MANC-RISK-SCREEN has been shown to have satisfactory internal and external validity for use in informing resource allocation decision-making. We suggest that MANC-RISK-SCREEN can be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of exemplars of risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programmes (NBSP) from the UK perspective. Implications: A step-by-step process for conducting the validation of a decision-analytic model was developed for future use by health economists. Using this approach may help researchers to fully demonstrate the strengths and limitations of their model to decision-makers.

11366214,Willis M,Budget impact models for lung cancer interventions: A systematic literature review,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2024,"- BACKGROUND:: Budget impact models (BIMs) forecast the financial implications of adopting new technologies and the potential need for budget reallocation, thus playing a crucial role in reimbursement decisions. Despite the importance of accurate forecasts, studies indicate large discrepancies between estimates and reality. We are developing an artificial intelligence–based clinical decision tool to identify patients with non–small cell lung cancer who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the budgetary implications and describe a systematic literature review of published lung cancer BIMs. METHODS:: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published between 2010 and 2023 that include BIMs that describe lung cancer interventions. Forward and backward reference searches were performed for all qualifying studies. We extracted author and publication year, country, interventions, disease stages, time horizon, analytical perspective, modeling methods used, types of costs included, sensitivity analyses conducted, and data sources used. We then evaluated adherence to the Professional Society for Health Economics and Pharmacoeconomics Research best-practice guidelines. RESULTS:: A total of 25 BIMs were identified, spanning 14 different countries. Model structure could not be ascertained definitively for nearly half of the models. The cost calculator approach was most common among the others. Time horizons ranged from 1 to 5 years, in line with recommendations. Most models compared drugs, 4 compared nondrug interventions, and 7 compared diagnostic technologies. Assumptions about market uptake were poorly documented and poorly motivated. Inclusion of cancer-related costs was rare. Adherence to best practices was variable and did not appear to improve over time. CONCLUSIONS:: The number of published BIMs for lung cancer exceeded expectations. There were modest trends toward publication frequency and model quality over time. Our analysis revealed variability across the models, as well as their adherence to best practices, indicating substantial room for improvement. Although none of the models were individually suitable for the purpose of evaluating an artificial intelligence–based treatment selection tool, some models provided valuable insights.",slr_bim
11812765,Pigeolet M,"Cost-effectiveness of screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip in Karachi, Pakistan using a universally applicable cost-effectiveness model",BMJ Public Health,2024,"- Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital anomaly of the hip socket that can lead to lifelong disability and pain when left untreated. DDH is a good candidate for screening because of its high frequency in population, availability of treatment and the possibility of secondary prevention. Pakistan currently does not have any systematic or universal neonatal screening programme for DDH. Methods: The cost-effectiveness model in this study uses one decision tree for each screening scenario: (1) the status quo, (2) universal screening by clinical examination, (3) universal screening by clinical examination with targeted ultrasound (US) screening, (4) and universal screening by US. Loss of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) is used as outcome variable. Results: When left untreated DDH creates a loss of 3.4 DALYs per person. Clinical examination and targeted US averts most DALYs per dollar spent. Generalised US averts more DALYs overall but requires a greater financial investment per DALY averted. Conclusions: Universal US screening reaches more children and can be considered the more equitable approach but requires 10 times the financial investment clinical examination and targeted US requires. The decision which option is most appropriate for Karachi, Pakistan depends on resource availability, geography, infrastructure, treatment capacity, health system values and societal factors in Pakistan.",cem
11849414,Siegfried C,Using QIP-MS to Guide the Timing of MRD Testing in Patients With Multiple Myeloma: A Budget Impact Analysis From the French Payer Perspective,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- Purpose: Serum or urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP or UPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE or UIFE) are routinely used to detect M-proteins in MM patients. However, SPEP and SIFE are not sensitive enough to measure M-protein levels that are low but still clinically significant. This study aimed to evaluate the potential cost savings associated with using the EXENT GAM Assay, a serum-based quantitative-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (QIP-MS) diagnostic test instead of SIFE to guide the timing of minimal residual disease (MRD) testing for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: A simple 2-year budget impact model was created in Excel using data from MM clinical trials and fee schedules. Patients are tested with either QIP-MS or SIFE at predetermined timepoints. If patients test negative, they will receive MRD testing. The result of the MRD test will determine if the preceding serum-based test was a true negative result (MRD test is negative) or a false negative result (MRD test is positive). Patients receiving autologous stem cell transplant (henceforth referred to as transplant) and those not receiving transplant are both eligible for one MRD test per year. MRD testing for transplant-eligible patients occurs prior to transplant and one year following transplant. Results: Across a hypothetical population of 5154 mm patients receiving 1st-line treatment in France, using QIP-MS instead of SIFE prior to MRD testing leads to 1973 fewer false negative results and 744 more false positive results (due, in part, to the detection of residual IgG). Net savings per QIP-MS test would be €260 or total savings of €2,481,832. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of QIP-MS prior to MRD testing may be cost-saving for testing French patients with MM.",bim
11871816,Goudarzi Z,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of rivaroxaban with or without aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients with coronary and peripheral artery diseases in Iran,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- Background: Low-dose aspirin and rivaroxaban are the cornerstone treatment for cardiovascular prevention in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). The combination of rivaroxaban with aspirin imposes a synergistic effect on the inhibition of factor-induced platelet aggregation. The present work aimed at comparing the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban alone (5 mg twice daily) with aspirin alone in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or coronary artery disease (CAD) and related subgroups. Methods: This pharmacoeconomic study was performed based on the insurance organization and utilized a state-transition decision Markov model. From the COMPASS trial, Clinical efficacy and Clinical events were collected. Health outcomes and cost were assessed over a 20-year time horizon (lifetime). The direct costs of medical services were included in the analysis. The results were stated based on Incremental Cost-Utility (ICUR) and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed utilizing deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Discount rates of .058 and .03 were included for cost and effectiveness data, respectively. The budget impact based on the Markov model was estimated as the financial burden resulting from the insurance coverage of rivaroxaban. Results: In the total of CAD and PAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were more expensive than the aspirin alone, but also more effective, resulting in ICUR being $4594/QALY and $13601/QALY respectively, and for ICER being $3348/LYG and $9901/LYG. In PAD patients rivaroxaban plus aspirin had higher effectiveness than aspirin alone that ICUR and ICER being $11929/QALY and $9896/LYG respectively. In CAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin was expensive and less effective than aspirin alone. The estimated annual budget impact was $28,253,135 for the rivaroxaban plus aspirin and $292,593,909 for the rivaroxaban alone in the total of CAD and PAD patients. Conclusions: This study showed that rivaroxaban plus aspirin is a cost-effective alternative in PAD and total of CAD and PAD patients. In CAD patients, rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were not cost-effective.",bim
11881394,Goudarzi Z,Value of cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment for Lennox Gastaut syndrome: cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,BMC Med,2025,"- Background: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. Methods: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. Results: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated. Conclusions: Compared to usual care, CBD seems to be cost-effective in LGS patients and sustainable, with less than 34% overall budget increased in the next 5 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word setting and in other countries.",bim
11884430,Samacá-Samacá D,Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of the Use of Faricimab in Diabetic Macular Edema and Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Colombia,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Retinal diseases are major contributors to disability, significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) represent a significant disease and economic burden in Colombia. Assessing the economic evaluation of available treatments is essential for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using faricimab for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD within the Colombian health system. Methods: This study used a 25-year Markov cohort model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of faricimab vs aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab. We used the methodological guidelines of the local health technology assessment agency for conducting the cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. Transition probabilities and injection frequencies were derived from the literature. Drug prices were retrieved from public local databases. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. The potential patient population for the budget impact analysis was estimated based on disease prevalence and expert consultations. Results: Faricimab treat-and-extend (T&E) was dominant vs aflibercept T&E (+0.22 QALYs), ranibizumab T&E (+0.55 QALYs), and brolucizumab for 8 to 12 weeks (+0.06 QALYs) in DME, generating cost savings (in US dollars) of 3849,1375, and 2824,respectively.InnAMD,faricimabalsoshoweddominancevsafliberceptasneeded(+0.12Q ALYs),ranibizumabasneeded(+0.05QALYs),andbrolucizumab8to12weeks(+0.12QALYs)withsa vingsin(US)7223, 5792,and6798, respectively. Assuming an annual market share increase for faricimab of 15% for DME and 13% for nAMD, the Colombian Health System could save 144millionover3years.Ofthesesavings,122.7 million are attributed to drug costs and 21.3milliontoadministrationcosts(US1 = Col$4325). Conclusion: Considering a willingness to pay threshold of $5988 per additional QALY, faricimab is a cost-effective alternative for both DME and nAMD for the Colombian healthcare system, showing dominance over other anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents. Faricimab provides better health outcomes at lower costs vs other treatments.",bim
11910135,Holtmaat K,Efficacy and Budget Impact of a Tailored Psychological Intervention Program Targeting Cancer Patients With Adjustment Disorder: A Randomised Controlled Trial,Psychooncology,2025,"- Background: Evidence on the efficacy of psychological interventions targeting cancer patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder is scarce. Aims: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD‐program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). Methods: Patients (n = 59) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD‐program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1–4 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health‐related quality of life (EORTC QLQ‐C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD‐program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD‐program. Results: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n = 33) decreased over time (M = 19.2 at T0, M = 15.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n = 26, M = 17.5 at T0, M = 15.9 at T6, p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD‐program was estimated at 7–28 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). Conclusions: The effect of the AD‐program was not statistically significant in this RCT. Limitations include that this study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties during the COVID‐19 pandemic. More research on the efficacy and implementation of the AD‐program is warranted.

11919128,Gómez-Barrera M,Nurse-Led Telephone Program for Nonadherent to Treatment Type 2 Diabetics With Comorbid Depression: A Cost-Consequence and Budget Impact Analysis,J Nurs Manag,2024,"- Objective: To estimate the efficiency of a nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent to treatment Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression (TELE-DD program).Design: Secondary analysis of cost-consequence and budget impact, utilizing data from a randomized clinical trial conducted in the primary healthcare setting. The target population consisted of Type 2 diabetic patients with comorbid depression who were nonadherent to their pharmacological treatment.Method: The average cost per controlled patient (glycated hemoglobin < 7%) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Similarly, the budgetary impact over 1 year of implementing this program in the region of reference of the randomized clinical trial was assessed.Results: The number of controlled patients is higher in the TELE-DD group at 6, 12, and 18 months. The average cost per controlled patient was higher in the TELE-DD group than in the control group at 6 months (€160.31 vs. €49.79), but lower at 12 (€150.09 vs. €179.59) and 18 months (€209.22 vs. €376.88). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 6, 12, and 18 months was €254.47, €143.65, and €177.46, respectively. The budget impact analysis revealed that implementing the TELE-DD program would result in a reduction of €721,940.68 in expenditure for the funder in the first year of application.Conclusions: A nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression is an efficient option in the management of healthcare resources. These results highlight the role of nursing in chronic patient management and the efficient use of healthcare resources.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04097483.",bim
11922778,Modi B,The Budget Impact of Cangrelor in the UK for the Treatment of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Who Require Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Cangrelor is an intravenous, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure, and in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable (for example, in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [OHCA] population). Objective: This study aimed to estimate the affordability and budget impact, in the United Kingdom, of introducing cangrelor within the licenced OHCA population. Methods: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of introducing cangrelor to hospitals over 5 years. Efficacy (thrombotic events) and safety (bleeding events) data were based on clinical trials, cost data (2021/22 GBP), literature, NHS reference costs and British National Formulary data. Comparators were glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and aspirin in combination with heparin, reflecting current treatments used in UK centres for the target population. Cangrelor uptake was estimated as 50% in Year 1, 75% in Year 2, and 100% in Years 3–5. The OHCA population was estimated from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society National Audit 2021/22. Results: Over 5 years, cangrelor leads to modelled cost savings of £2,709,853 (−9.84%), varying from £322,218 in Year 1 (−5.85%) to £636,150 (−11.55%) in Year 5). This is driven by approximately 6,882 hospital days being avoided over 5 years due to fewer bleeding events. Conclusion: Cangrelor for OHCA patients who cannot take oral P2Y12 inhibitors may lead to cost savings in the UK.",bim
11927220,Maphanga B,The budget impact analysis of nicotine replacement therapy among patients who smoke tobacco and have mental illness in South Africa and the implications,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- Background: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death, with the highest burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those who have mental illness are particularly vulnerable, with a smoking rate two to five times higher than that of the general population. Quitting smoking has demonstrated benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving the quality of life. However, the economic feasibility of introducing Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the psychiatric medical environment in South Africa has not yet been explored. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the impact on the budget of implementing an NRT-based smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital. Methods: This retrospective and cross-sectional study followed a budget impact analysis framework. Data were retrieved between May 19 and Aug 18, 2023, from 214 patients' medical records. Using primary and secondary data, an ingredients costing approach was used to estimate direct treatment costs of NRT smoking cessation. All costs were expressed in ZAR (South African currency). The economic evaluation was conducted from the payer's perspective, and the results were reported at a 5% discount rate. A two-way 10% sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results: The study showed that study participants were primarily black, male, unemployed, diagnosed with schizophrenia and smoked lightly (69.16% ±3.46). Implementing the 3-month treatment period of NRT smoking cessation program would result in an expenditure of R1 478 915.42 for 214 patients. The hospital will require an additional 0.15% (±0.0095) of the total hospital budget and 6.09% (±0.31) of the hospital pharmacy budget. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that while implementing a NRT is crucial for improving the overall health outcomes among patients with mental illnesses, substantial investment would be required. The budgetary allocation for NRT smoking cessation interventions would vary by treatment settings and program duration. Consequently, careful consideration of budget allocation and resource distribution is necessary to ensure the program's sustainability within the broader healthcare framework in South Africa.",bim
11936304,McCullough HP,"The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation mHealth Intervention for People Experiencing Homelessness: Cost Analysis, Exploratory Financial Cost-Benefit Analysis, and Budget Impact Analysis",JMIR Form Res,2025,"- Background: The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation (iCAN) mobile health intervention aims to improve care coordination and reduce hospital and emergency department visits among people experiencing homelessness. Objective: This study aimed to conduct a three-part economic evaluation of iCAN, including a (1) cost analysis, (2) exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis, and (3) budget impact analysis (BIA). Methods: We collected cost and expenditure data from a randomized controlled trial of iCAN to conduct a cost analysis and exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis. Costs were classified as startup and recurring costs for participants and the program. Startup costs included participant supplies for each participant and SMS implementation costs. Recurring costs included the cost of recurring services, SMS text messaging platform maintenance, health information access fees, and personnel salaries. Using the per participant per year (PPPY) costs of iCAN, the minimum savings reduction in the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness that would lead to a benefit-cost ratio >1 for iCAN was calculated. This savings threshold was calculated by dividing the PPPY cost of iCAN by the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness multiplied by 100%. The benefit-cost ratio of iCAN was calculated under different savings thresholds from 0% (no savings) to 50%. Costs were calculated PPPY under different scenarios, and the results were used as inputs in a BIA. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate uncertainty around cost estimates. Costs are in 2022 US $. Results: The total cost of iCAN was US $2865 PPPY, which was made up of US $265 in startup (9%) and US $2600 (91%) in recurring costs PPPY. The minimum savings threshold that would cause iCAN to have a positive return on investment is 7.8%. This means that if average health care costs (US $36,917) among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. When health care costs are reduced by 25% ($9229/$36,917; equal to 56% [$9229/$16,609] of the average cost of an inpatient visit), the benefit-cost ratio is 3.22, which means that iCAN produces US $2.22 in health care savings per US $1 spent. The BIA estimated that implementing iCAN for 10,250 people experiencing homelessness over 5 years would have a financial cost of US $28.7 million, which could be reduced to US $2.2 million if at least 8% ($2880/$36,917) of average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness are reduced through the intervention. Conclusions: If average costs of emergency department and hospital visits among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% ($2880/$36,917) through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. As the savings threshold increases, it results in a higher benefit-cost ratio.",bim
11953859,Shafrin J,Economic impact of sotagliflozin among patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes: Budget impact analysis from the US payer perspective,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2025,"- BACKGROUND:: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States, often complicated by comorbidities like diabetes mellitus. These patients face high hospitalization risks, impacting clinical outcomes and health care resources. The Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that sotagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, reduced rehospitalizations in patients with HF and diabetes mellitus. Although clinically beneficial, the economic impact of sotagliflozin from a payer perspective remains unclear, warranting further pharmacoeconomic analysis to guide managed care decisions. OBJECTIVE:: To quantify the budget impact of sotagliflozin for US payers over a 5-year time horizon. METHODS:: A payer-perspective budget impact model was developed to assess the financial impact of incorporating sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients recently hospitalized for HF with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 5 years to US payer health plans. The study used a population reflecting the SOLOIST-WHF clinical trial, with economic parameters adjusted by payer mix (all payer, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid). Health care resource utilization included hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and adverse events’ care. Economic outcomes examined the medical and pharmacy budget impact for payers at the per-user, per member per month (PMPM), and total plan costs levels. RESULTS:: For a hypothetical 1-million-member all-payer plan, 1,516 patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid T2D would be eligible for sotagliflozin. For all-payer plans, annual per-user costs increased by $4,996 because of higher pharmacy costs ($8,260) but were partially offset by lower medical costs (−$2,608) because of reduced rehospitalization and ED visits from sotagliflozin. PMPM total budget impact of sotagliflozin would be $0.08 PMPM in year 1 and $0.38 in year 5, corresponding with total plan cost of $75,736 in year 1 and $378,681 by year 5. Commercial payer PMPM costs were lower ($0.02 in year 1; $0.11 in year 5), and higher for Medicare ($0.23 PMPM in year 1, increasing to 1.13 PMPM in year 5). Breakeven rebate rates ranged between 31.5% and 79.4%. CONCLUSIONS:: Although sotagliflozin increases pharmacy costs for recently hospitalized HF patients with T2D, approximately 21%-68% of pharmacy costs were offset from reduced rehospitalization and ED visits.",bim
6149200,Doble B,Health-related quality of life impact of minor and major bleeding events during dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic literature review and patient preference elicitation study,Health Qual Life Outcomes,2018,"- Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the recommended preventative treatment for secondary ischaemic events, but increases the risk of bleeding, potentially affecting patients’ health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). Varied utility decrements have been used in cost-effectiveness models assessing alternative DAPT regimens, but it is unclear which of these decrements are most appropriate. Therefore, we reviewed existing sources of utility decrements for bleeds in patients receiving DAPT and undertook primary research to estimate utility decrements through a patient elicitation exercise using vignettes and the EuroQol EQ-5D. Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed and references of included studies were searched. Primary research and decision analytic modelling studies reporting utility decrements for bleeds related to DAPT were considered. For the primary research study, 21 participants completed an elicitation exercise involving vignettes describing minor and major bleeds and the EQ-5D-3 L and EQ-5D-5 L. Utility decrements were derived using linear regression and compared to existing estimates. Results: Four hundred forty-two citations were screened, of which 12 studies were included for review. Reported utility decrements ranged from − 0.002 to − 0.03 for minor bleeds and − 0.007 to − 0.05 for major bleeds. Data sources used to estimate the decrements, however, lacked relevance to our population group and few studies adequately reported details of their measurement and valuation approaches. No study completely adhered to reimbursement agency requirements in the UK according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence reference case. Our primary research elicited utility decrements overlapped existing estimates, ranging from − 0.000848 to − 0.00828 for minor bleeds and − 0.0187 to − 0.0621 for major bleeds. However, the magnitude of difference depended on the instrument, estimation method and valuation approach applied. Conclusions: Several sources of utility decrements for bleeds are available for use in cost-effectiveness analyses, but are of limited quality and relevance. Our elicitation exercise has derived utility decrements from a relevant patient population, based on standardised definitions of minor and major bleeding events, using a validated HRQoL instrument and have been valued using general population tariffs. We suggest that our utility decrements be used in future cost-effectiveness analyses of DAPT.

8079293,Keeney E,Using a Modified Delphi Approach to Gain Consensus on Relevant Comparators in a Cost-Effectiveness Model: Application to Prostate Cancer Screening,Pharmacoeconomics,2021,"- Objective: Challenges can exist when framing the decision question in a cost-effectiveness analysis, particularly when there is disagreement among experts on relevant comparators. Using prostate cancer screening and recent developments in risk stratification, early-detection biomarkers, and diagnostic technologies as a case study, we report a modified Delphi approach to handle decision-question uncertainty. Methods: The study involved two rounds of anonymous online questionnaires to identify the prostate cancer screening strategies that international researchers, clinicians and decision makers felt important to consider in a cost-effectiveness model. Both purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit experts. The questionnaire was based on a review of the literature and was piloted for language, comprehension and ease of use prior to dissemination. In Round 1, respondents indicated their preferred screening strategy (including no screening) through a series of multiple-choice questions. The responses informed a set of 13 consensus statements, which respondents ranked their agreement with on a 9-point Likert scale (Round 2). Consensus was considered reached if > 70% of participants indicated agreement and < 15% indicated disagreement. Results: Twenty participants completed Round 1 and 17 completed Round 2. Consensus was shown towards comparing no formal screening, age-based, and risk-based strategies. The risk-based approaches included screening only higher-risk men, using shorter screening intervals for higher-risk men, screening higher-risk men at an earlier age, and tailoring screening intervals based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at a previous test. There was agreement that inclusion of MRI in the pathway should be considered, but disagreement on the inclusion of new biomarkers. Conclusion: In disease areas where technologies are rapidly evolving, a modified Delphi approach provides a useful tool to identify relevant comparators in an economic evaluation.

9724412,Putri S,Supporting dialysis policy for end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Indonesia: an updated cost-effectiveness model,BMC Res Notes,2022,"- Objective: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD) are main modalities for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and those have been covered by National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme since 2014 in Indonesia. This study aims to update the cost-effectiveness model of CAPD versus HD in Indonesia setting. Results: Compared to HD, CAPD provides good value for money among ESRD patients in Indonesia. Using societal perspective, the total costs were IDR 1,348,612,118 (USD 95,504) and IDR 1,368,447,750 (USD 96,908), for CAPD and HD, respectively. The QALY was slightly different between two modalities, 4.79 for CAPD versus 4.22 for HD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) yields savings of IDR 34,723,527/QALY (USD 2460).

9831030,LeBlanc K,A Cost-Effectiveness Model to Determine Ostomy-Related Costs of Care and Health Outcomes Among People With an Ostomy in Canada Using a Ceramide-Infused Skin Barrier,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,2023,"- The aim of this study was to determine whether a difference exists in the financial impact of the use of a 2-piece ceramide-infused skin barrier (CIB) versus standard of care barrier (SOC) in Ontario and Alberta using a cost-effectiveness model over a 1-year period for people with a fecal or urinary ostomy.DESIGN:: A cost-effectiveness model adapted from a previously published work. SUBJECTS AND SETTING:: The model was populated with data inputs from a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta. Model results were assessed for robustness via the use of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta were chosen because cost data were readily accessible. The combined population of these provinces accounts for 50% of Canada's population. RESULTS:: An expected cost savings of Can$443.13 (US $322.60) and Can$243.84 (US $177.52) per user for the hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta per year was obtained for those using a CIB versus a non-infused skin barrier in Ontario and Alberta, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CIB to SOC per peristomal skin complication (PSC) avoided and per quality-adjusted life day (QALD) gained was approximately Can$2702 (US $1967)/PSC and Can$1266 (US $922)/QALD for Ontario and approximately Can$1487 (US $1083)/PSC and Can$697 (US $507)/QALD for Alberta. Analysis indicated CIBs remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS:: Finding suggest that a CIB is cost-effective when compared to a barrier not infused with ceramide when applied to persons with an ostomy and residing in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario.",cem
