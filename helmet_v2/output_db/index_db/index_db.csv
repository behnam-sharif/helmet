10760782,Abraham K,Benefits of a digital health technology for older nursing home residents. A de-novo cost-effectiveness model for digital health technologies to aid in the assessment of toileting and containment care needs,PLoS One,2024,"- The aim of this study was first, to introduce a comprehensive, de-novo health economic (HE) model incorporating the full range of activities involved in toileting and containment care (T&CC) for people with incontinence, capturing all the potential benefits and costs of existing and future Digital Health Technologies (DHT) aimed at improving continence care, for both residential care and home care. Second, to use this novel model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the DHT TENA SmartCare Identifi in the implementation of person-centred continence care (PCCC), compared with conventional continence care for Canadian nursing home residents. The de-novo HE model was designed to evaluate technologies across different care settings from the perspective of several stakeholders. Health states were based on six care need profiles with increasing need for toileting assistance, three care stages with varying degrees of toileting success, and five levels of skin health. The main outcomes were incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years. The effectiveness of the TENA SmartCare Identifi was based primarily on trial data combined with literature and expert opinion where necessary. Costs were reported in CAD 2020. After 2 years, 21% of residents in the DHT group received mainly toileting as their continence care strategy compared with 12% in the conventional care group. Conversely, with the DHT 15% of residents rely mainly on absorbent products for incontinence care, compared with 40% with conventional care. On average, residents lived for 2.34 years, during which the DHT resulted in a small gain in quality-adjusted life years of 0.015 and overall cost-savings of $1,467 per resident compared with conventional care. Most cost-savings were achieved through reduced costs for absorbent products. Since most, if not all, stakeholders gain from use of the DHT-assisted PCCC, widespread use in Canadian residential care facilities should be considered, and similar assessments for other countries encouraged.",cem
11922778,Modi B,The Budget Impact of Cangrelor in the UK for the Treatment of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Who Require Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Cangrelor is an intravenous, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure, and in whom oral therapy with P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable (for example, in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [OHCA] population). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the affordability and budget impact, in the United Kingdom, of introducing cangrelor within the licenced OHCA population. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the impact of introducing cangrelor to hospitals over 5 years. Efficacy (thrombotic events) and safety (bleeding events) data were based on clinical trials, cost data (2021/22 GBP), literature, NHS reference costs and British National Formulary data. Comparators were glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and aspirin in combination with heparin, reflecting current treatments used in UK centres for the target population. Cangrelor uptake was estimated as 50% in Year 1, 75% in Year 2, and 100% in Years 3-5. The OHCA population was estimated from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society National Audit 2021/22. RESULTS: Over 5 years, cangrelor leads to modelled cost savings of £2,709,853 (-9.84%), varying from £322,218 in Year 1 (-5.85%) to £636,150 (-11.55%) in Year 5). This is driven by approximately 6,882 hospital days being avoided over 5 years due to fewer bleeding events. CONCLUSION: Cangrelor for OHCA patients who cannot take oral P2Y12 inhibitors may lead to cost savings in the UK.",bim
11999704,Prosperini L,Cost-Minimization Analysis and Budget Impact Analysis About Subcutaneous Natalizumab in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis in Italy,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- PURPOSE: Two analyses, a cost-minimization and a budget impact, were conducted to estimate the economic and financial impact of subcutaneous (SC) vs intravenous (IV) natalizumab in terms of administration times and costs in the Italian setting from the perspective of multiple sclerosis (MS) center, patient, and society. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cost minimization analysis (CMA) adopted a Markov model with three different states, and it is based on the results of REFINE study and its post-hoc analysis, which evaluated and demonstrated the non-inferiority of natalizumab SC vs IV formulation. The economic inputs came mainly from EASIER study, that estimated the administration time, resource consumption, and costs of natalizumab SC vs IV. A lifetime horizon was considered. Budget impact analysis (BIA) was conducted with a cost calculator approach and compared a base scenario (without SC natalizumab) with an alternative scenario (with SC natalizumab). The inputs were shared with the CMA and a 3-year time horizon was considered. A progressive increase in the number of patients treated with natalizumab SC was estimated from the 1st to the 2nd to the 3rd year after reimbursement in Italy. RESULTS: CMA estimated that savings due to the use of SC instead of IV natalizumab would be €2,824, €1,137, and €9,170 per patient from the perspectives of MS center, patient, and society, respectively, thus depicting a weak dominance (lower costs and non-inferiority efficacy). BIA estimated that the savings were approximately 3.2 million euros from the perspective of MS centers and around 10.3 million euros from the perspective of society in the first 3 years following reimbursement. CONCLUSION: Administering natalizumab subcutaneously rather than intravenously to treatment-eligible patients would result in administration time and cost savings thus determining a favorable impact for the MS center, the patient and the society.",bim
10948140,Paoli CJ,Effectiveness of Single-Tablet Combination Therapy in Improving Adherence and Persistence and the Relation to Clinical and Economic Outcomes,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2024,"- Background: Single-tablet combination therapies (STCTs) combine multiple drugs into one formulation, making drug administration more convenient for patients. STCTs were developed to address concerns with treatment adherence and persistence, but the impact of STCT use is not fully understood across indications.Objectives: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine STCT-associated outcomes across 4 evidence domains: clinical trials, real-world evidence (RWE), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) studies, and economic evaluations.Methods: Four SLRs were conducted across the aforementioned domains. Included studies compared STCTs as well as fixed-dose combinations ([FDCs] of non-tablet formulations) with the equivalent active compounds and doses in loose-dose combinations (LDCs). Original research articles were included; case reports, case series, and non-English-language sources were excluded. Databases searched included EconLit, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE® ALL. Two independent reviewers assessed relevant studies and extracted data. Conflicts were resolved with a third reviewer or consensus-based discussion.Results: In all, 109 studies were identified; 27 studies were identified in more than one SLR. Treatment adherence was significantly higher in patients receiving FDCs vs LDCs in 12 of 13 RWE studies and 3 of 13 clinical trials. All 18 RWE studies reported higher persistence with FDCs. In RWE studies examining clinical outcomes (n = 17), 14 reported positive findings with FDCs, including a reduced need for add-on medication, blood pressure control, and improved hemoglobin A1C. HRQoL studies generally reported numerical improvements with STCTs or similarities between STCTs and LDCs. Economic outcomes favored STCT use. All 6 cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses found FDCs were less expensive and more efficacious than LDCs. Four budget impact models found that STCTs were associated with cost savings. Medical costs and healthcare resource use were generally lower with FDCs than with LDCs.Discussion: Evidence from RWE and economic studies strongly favored STCT use, while clinical trials and HRQoL studies primarily reported similarity between STCTs and LDCs. This may be due to clinical trial procedures aimed at maximizing adherence and HRQoL measures that are not designed to evaluate drug administration.Conclusions: Our findings highlight the value of STCTs for improving patient adherence, persistence, and clinical outcomes while also offering economic advantages.",slr_bim
12038200,Inshasi J,Cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in the United Arab Emirates,Ther Adv Neurol Disord,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, associated with demyelination and inflammation. Relapsing forms of MS (RMS) encompass all patients with MS experiencing relapses. While there is currently no cure for MS, the introduction of several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) has significantly reduced the risk of relapse and disability in patients with MS. There is a high unmet need for an easy-to-administer DMT that can be used early in the treatment pathway. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab compared with other commonly used DMTs for the treatment of RMS from a health payer perspective in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A Markov model, based on expanded disability status scale (EDSS) health states, was developed using the UAE payer's perspective and a 65-year time horizon. The baseline patient distribution across the EDSS states was aligned to the population of ASCLEPIOS I and II trials. The British Columbia database informed natural history transition probabilities. Treatment effects were applied by delaying disability progression and reducing the number of relapses and were sourced from a network meta-analysis. The health care resource utilization was derived from interviews with local experts, who also validated the model structure and comparators, and utility inputs from published studies. In the absence of an officially defined willingness-to-pay threshold in the UAE, it was assumed to be United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) 369,854 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), which is twice the UAE gross domestic product per capita. RESULTS: Base-case results indicated that ofatumumab was dominant over ocrelizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and natalizumab intravenous; was more cost-effective compared with teriflunomide, fingolimod (generic), glatiramer acetate, interferons, and best supportive care; and resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AED 713,068 per QALY versus cladribine. Sensitivity analyses were in line with the results of the base-case analysis. CONCLUSION: From the UAE payer's perspective, ofatumumab could be a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with RMS.",cem
12043179,Malhotra A,Cost and cost-effectiveness of pediatric home-based versus facility-based TB Preventive Treatment in Ethiopia (CHIP-TB),PLOS Glob Public Health,2025,"- Tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is an essential intervention recommended for all child contacts in Ethiopia under 15 years who are at risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection. We conducted a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of home-based versus facility-based TPT provision for child contacts in Ethiopia. As part of the CHIP TB trial, a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial conducted at eighteen clinics in Ethiopia, clinics were randomized to either a home-based model (intervention arm), administered by community health workers, or a facility-based model (standard of care) for managing child contacts. Cost data were collected from both a health service perspective and a household perspective, capturing all costs relevant to TPT. Costs were evaluated on a per-household basis, with the primary outcome being the difference in median costs per household initiating TPT. A secondary outcome assessed the cost-effectiveness as the incremental cost per additional child contact starting TPT. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to examine the robustness of findings. At an average cost of US$18.92 per household managed, Home-based contact management, including TPT delivery was cost-saving compared to facility-based TPT delivery (US$27.24 per household managed) assessed based on the partial-societal perspectives, largely due to reductions in household out-of-pocket costs. The home-based strategy was both less costly and had increased TPT initiation in 61.5% of the scenarios assessed in the PSA. Home-based contact management is a cost-saving alternative for households and provides comparable initiation rates to facility-based care, making it a feasible approach to improve TB preventive treatment accessibility. Although it does not entirely replace facility-based care, a hybrid model that respects household preferences and allows flexibility in delivery could enhance TB care access for socio-economically disadvantaged households, potentially reducing health inequities. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov NCT04369326 on April 30, 2020. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04369326.",cem
11136791,Paulissen JH,Cost-effectiveness model of trastuzumab deruxtecan as second-line treatment in HER2-positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in Finland,Eur J Health Econ,2023,"- Objectives: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) was recently recommended by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use as a treatment for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, who had received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. In our study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of T-DXd compared with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for this indication in Finland. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival analysis model was developed with a payer’s perspective. Time to event data from the DESTINY-Breast03 (DB-03) trial were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon either directly—for progression-free survival and time to treatment discontinuation—or using an alternative approach utilizing long-term T-DM1 survival data and DB-03 data—for overall survival. Discount rates of 3% were applied for costs and effects. Inputs were sourced from the Medicinal Products Database from Kela, Helsinki University Hospital service price list, Finnish Medicines Agency assessments, clinical experts, and DB-03. Sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize and demonstrate parameter uncertainties in the model. Results: Total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years (LYs) gained for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were 1.93 and 2.56, respectively. Incremental costs for T-DXd compared with T-DM1 were €106,800, resulting in an ICER of €55,360 per QALY gained and an ICER of €41,775 per LY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the hazard ratio of T-DXd vs T-DM1 for OS was the most influential parameter. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed similar results to the base case. Conclusions: T-DXd is cost-effective based on surrogate WTP thresholds of €72,000 and €139,000 per QALY.

9724412,Putri S,Supporting dialysis policy for end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Indonesia: an updated cost-effectiveness model,BMC Res Notes,2022,"- Objective: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD) are main modalities for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and those have been covered by National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme since 2014 in Indonesia. This study aims to update the cost-effectiveness model of CAPD versus HD in Indonesia setting. Results: Compared to HD, CAPD provides good value for money among ESRD patients in Indonesia. Using societal perspective, the total costs were IDR 1,348,612,118 (USD 95,504) and IDR 1,368,447,750 (USD 96,908), for CAPD and HD, respectively. The QALY was slightly different between two modalities, 4.79 for CAPD versus 4.22 for HD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) yields savings of IDR 34,723,527/QALY (USD 2460).

12045074,Nilsson K,Cost-effectiveness analysis of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low risk of surgical mortality in Sweden,Ups J Med Sci,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has shown similar or improved clinical outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical mortality. This cost-utility analysis compared TAVI with SAPIEN 3 versus SAVR in symptomatic severe aortic stenosis patients at low risk of surgical mortality from the perspective of the Swedish healthcare system. METHODS: A published, two-stage, Markov-based cost-utility model that captured clinical outcomes from the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated according to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry (2018-2020) was adapted from the perspective of the Swedish healthcare system using local general population mortality, utility and costs data. The model had a lifetime horizon. Model outputs included changes in direct healthcare costs and health-related quality of life from using TAVI as compared with SAVR. RESULTS: TAVI with SAPIEN 3 resulted in lifetime costs per patient of 484,142 SEK Swedish krona (SEK) and lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient of 7.16, whilst SAVR resulted in lifetime costs and QALYs per patient of 457,625 SEK and 6.81 QALYs, respectively. Compared with SAVR, TAVI offered an incremental improvement of +0.35 QALY per patient at an increased cost of +26,517 SEK per patient over a lifetime horizon, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 76,532 SEK per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: TAVI with SAPIEN 3 is a cost-effective option versus SAVR for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at low risk for surgical mortality treated in the Swedish healthcare setting. These findings may inform policy decisions in Sweden for the management of this patient group.",cem
10333156,Lin YS,A Simple Cost-Effectiveness Model of Screening: An Open-Source Teaching and Research Tool Coded in R,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- Applied cost-effectiveness analysis models are an important tool for assessing health and economic effects of healthcare interventions but are not best suited for illustrating methods. Our objective is to provide a simple, open-source model for the simulation of disease-screening cost-effectiveness for teaching and research purposes. We introduce our model and provide an initial application to examine changes to the efficiency frontier as input parameters vary and to demonstrate face validity. We described a vectorised, discrete-event simulation of screening in R with an Excel interface to define parameters and inspect principal results. An R Shiny app permits dynamic interpretation of simulation outputs. An example with 8161 screening strategies illustrates the cost and effectiveness of varying the disease sojourn time, treatment effectiveness, and test performance characteristics and costs on screening policies. Many of our findings are intuitive and straightforward, such as a reduction in screening costs leading to decreased overall costs and improved cost-effectiveness. Others are less obvious and depend on whether we consider gross outcomes or those net to no screening. For instance, enhanced treatment of symptomatic disease increases gross effectiveness, but reduces the net effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening. A lengthening of the preclinical sojourn time has ambiguous effects relative to no screening, as cost-effectiveness improves for some strategies but deteriorates for others. Our simple model offers an accessible platform for methods research and teaching. We hope it will serve as a public good and promote an intuitive understanding of the cost-effectiveness of screening.",cem
12042820,Antillon M,Microarray patch vaccines for typhoid conjugate vaccines: A global cost-effectiveness analysis,Vaccine,2025,"- A novel typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) presentation, the microarray patch (MAP), is in early-stage development and could potentially help to increase coverage in hard-to-reach populations beyond what is being achieved with the current TCV in a vial presentation administered with a needle and syringe (TCV-N&S). However, TCV-MAPs may come at a higher price per dose than TCV-N&S. Our analysis evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of TCV-MAPs alongside TCV-N&S compared to TCV-N&S alone. A global extended cost-effectiveness analysis, taking a health care perspective, was conducted for 133 low- to upper-middle-income countries for a time horizon of 20 years (2033-2052). Health outcomes were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs in 2021 US dollars, both discounted at 3 %. We assumed TCV-MAP would cost 1.33 to 3 times the price of the TCV-N&S vaccine. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and evaluated them against various cost-effectiveness thresholds. For five selected countries, we conducted an additional subnational analysis to understand the potential value of a district-specific TCV-MAP implementation instead of a national rollout. Across the 133 low- to upper-middle-income countries, national rollout of TCV-MAPs could avert an additional 5.2 million cases, 47,000 deaths, and 2.4 million DALYs compared to TCV-N&S only, at an additional cost of US$3.5 billion over 20 years. The largest proportion of the averted burden would be in the sub-Saharan African region. TCV-MAPs could be cost-effective in 33 % of the countries but in 78 % of sub-Saharan African countries. A subnational implementation could benefit some countries for which a national implementation may not be cost-effective, averting 2-15 % of cases for less than 1-3 % of the additional cost as compared to a national rollout. MAP price was a key driver of the results. Regional or subnational implementation, coupled with a lower price point, could significantly improve the TCV-MAP value proposition.",cem
12049938,Rehse H,Assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a smart home emergency call system: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in Germany,BMJ Open,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Falls can lead to serious health-related consequences in the older population. If an emergency occurs within the home environment of an older person living alone, the initiation of emergency care can be delayed, leading to even worse outcomes for this population. Smart home emergency call systems (HECSs) can detect falls and automatically trigger an emergency alarm, potentially reducing time to emergency care and improving outcomes. The INES (Intelligentes NotfallErkennungsSystem-smart emergency detection system) study is a prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in three German federal states that aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a smart HECS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Following a telephone interview, individuals aged 70 years or older, living alone, at risk of falling and willing to participate are included in the study. Participants are assigned to one of two groups depending on their previous use of a HECS. Based on the sample size calculation, the study aims to recruit n=498 participants already using a standard HECS (group A) and n=1378 participants who have not used a HECS before (group B). Within both groups, participants are randomised into the intervention arm (IA) and control arm (CA). The IA receives a smart HECS during the 21-month follow-up period. In addition to a standard HECS with a base station and a wearable radio transmitter, the smart HECS includes sensors that can detect falls and automatically trigger an alarm. The primary outcome assessed will be the days spent in the hospital after an emergency admission. Secondary outcomes include the utilisation of healthcare services and their total costs, progression of care dependency, fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and well-being (ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The design and conceptualisation of the INES study were approved by the ethics committee of the Hamburg Medical Association on 26 June 2023 (2023-101032-BO-ff). Results of the INES study will be published in peer-reviewed articles. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien, German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00031408.

12041651,Berti G,Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatments for symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients: network meta-analysis and budget impact analysis,Front Pharmacol,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Remdesivir (RDV) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NRM/RTV) are two antiviral agents for treating outpatient adults with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 at high risk of developing a severe disease. The review objectives are to compare the efficacy and safety of these antivirals based on published RCT and real-world data, and to evaluate costs from a healthcare perspective. METHODS: This study provides a network meta-analysis of RDV and NRM/RTV for early treatment of COVID-19. The outcomes analysed were hospitalisation for any cause and serious adverse events. A cost-analysis was performed incorporating drug costs, administration, hospitalisations, and management of adverse events. A budget impact analysis was estimated for the University Hospital of Padua. RESULTS: Our results indicated that RDV showed a trend towards a lower risk of hospitalisation compared to NRM/RTV (RR 1.59, 95% CI: 0.60-4.20), though this was not statistically significant. For safety, NRM/RTV demonstrated a slightly lower risk of serious adverse events compared to RDV (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.31-2.74), but without statistical significance. A cost analysis showed that NRM/RTV could save €550,854.46 per 1,000 patients. Finally, a budget impact analysis based on data from the University Hospital of Padua estimated annual savings of €210,977.25 if all early treatments were administered with NRM/RTV instead of RDV. DISCUSSION: The comparison of the two antiviral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 did not yield statistically significant differences in the potential efficacy and safety to prevent hospitalisation or serious adverse events. However, the results of the cost-analysis showed a saving in favour of NRM/RTV.",bim
12039530,Su HY,Within-trial cost-effectiveness of novel macrophage-regulating treatment on wound healing in patients with diabetic foot ulcers,J Food Drug Anal,2025,"- An M1/M2 macrophage-regulating treatment, ON101 cream, has shown its superior healing efficacy for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) versus standard absorbent dressing, according to a phase III trial. Given its high cost, corroborating the economic value of ON101 treatment can facilitate clinical and policy decision-makings. This study sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ON101 versus an absorbent dressing for patients with DFUs from Taiwan's healthcare sector perspective. This economic evaluation utilized effectiveness and cost data (in 2022 USD) from a randomized controlled trial of ON101, published literature, and Taiwan's National Health Insurance program. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) against willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was estimated to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Over a mean follow-up of 12.69 weeks in the full analysis set of patients (n = 236), 6 patients would need to be treated with ON101 versus the absorbent dressing to obtain a case of complete healing, which costed US$21,128 per complete-healing case gained. This ICER value was below WTP threshold of US$32,788. Cost-effective findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses, and more remarkable for patients with Wagner grade 2 ulcers, HbA(1c) >7%, and plantar ulcers. All these results were similar in modified intention-to-treat set. The high upfront drug cost of ON101 could be offset by its superior healing efficacy. Considering key prognostic factors for DFUs while optimizing the allocation of limited healthcare budgets, ON101 should be prioritized for severe cases with poor ulcer prognosis.",cem
11366214,Willis M,Budget impact models for lung cancer interventions: A systematic literature review,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2024,"- BACKGROUND:: Budget impact models (BIMs) forecast the financial implications of adopting new technologies and the potential need for budget reallocation, thus playing a crucial role in reimbursement decisions. Despite the importance of accurate forecasts, studies indicate large discrepancies between estimates and reality. We are developing an artificial intelligence–based clinical decision tool to identify patients with non–small cell lung cancer who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE:: To evaluate the budgetary implications and describe a systematic literature review of published lung cancer BIMs. METHODS:: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published between 2010 and 2023 that include BIMs that describe lung cancer interventions. Forward and backward reference searches were performed for all qualifying studies. We extracted author and publication year, country, interventions, disease stages, time horizon, analytical perspective, modeling methods used, types of costs included, sensitivity analyses conducted, and data sources used. We then evaluated adherence to the Professional Society for Health Economics and Pharmacoeconomics Research best-practice guidelines. RESULTS:: A total of 25 BIMs were identified, spanning 14 different countries. Model structure could not be ascertained definitively for nearly half of the models. The cost calculator approach was most common among the others. Time horizons ranged from 1 to 5 years, in line with recommendations. Most models compared drugs, 4 compared nondrug interventions, and 7 compared diagnostic technologies. Assumptions about market uptake were poorly documented and poorly motivated. Inclusion of cancer-related costs was rare. Adherence to best practices was variable and did not appear to improve over time. CONCLUSIONS:: The number of published BIMs for lung cancer exceeded expectations. There were modest trends toward publication frequency and model quality over time. Our analysis revealed variability across the models, as well as their adherence to best practices, indicating substantial room for improvement. Although none of the models were individually suitable for the purpose of evaluating an artificial intelligence–based treatment selection tool, some models provided valuable insights.",slr_bim
9831030,LeBlanc K,A Cost-Effectiveness Model to Determine Ostomy-Related Costs of Care and Health Outcomes Among People With an Ostomy in Canada Using a Ceramide-Infused Skin Barrier,J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,2023,"- The aim of this study was to determine whether a difference exists in the financial impact of the use of a 2-piece ceramide-infused skin barrier (CIB) versus standard of care barrier (SOC) in Ontario and Alberta using a cost-effectiveness model over a 1-year period for people with a fecal or urinary ostomy.DESIGN:: A cost-effectiveness model adapted from a previously published work. SUBJECTS AND SETTING:: The model was populated with data inputs from a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta. Model results were assessed for robustness via the use of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta were chosen because cost data were readily accessible. The combined population of these provinces accounts for 50% of Canada's population. RESULTS:: An expected cost savings of Can$443.13 (US $322.60) and Can$243.84 (US $177.52) per user for the hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals in Ontario and 4000 in Alberta per year was obtained for those using a CIB versus a non-infused skin barrier in Ontario and Alberta, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CIB to SOC per peristomal skin complication (PSC) avoided and per quality-adjusted life day (QALD) gained was approximately Can$2702 (US $1967)/PSC and Can$1266 (US $922)/QALD for Ontario and approximately Can$1487 (US $1083)/PSC and Can$697 (US $507)/QALD for Alberta. Analysis indicated CIBs remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS:: Finding suggest that a CIB is cost-effective when compared to a barrier not infused with ceramide when applied to persons with an ostomy and residing in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario.",cem
10455716,Sangeetha G,A Cost-effectiveness Model Comparing Urinary Biomarkers with Diuretic Renogram in Diagnosing Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction in Children,J Indian Assoc Pediatr Surg,2023,"- Background and Aims:: In this cost-effectiveness model, we compared the cost-effectiveness of commonly used urinary biomarkers with conventional diuretic renogram (DR) in diagnosing ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). We hypothesized that urinary biomarkers are as effective as DR. Methods:: We used incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as a tool for our cost-effectiveness analysis model. The cost of biomarker assay and renogram were sourced from the same center while the accuracy data of DR and urinary biomarkers from the relevant pubications. Results:: As the accuracy of individual biomarker increased, the ICER also got better. As a panel of biomarker was introduced, the ICER went to the negative range suggesting cost saving as well. ICER of most urine biomarkers is currently less expensive and less effective. When a biomarker panel was applied ICER became more expensive and effective. With higher samples, test running cost is likely to go down in future and thus biomarkers are likely become less expensive and more effective. Conclusions:: Individual urine biomarkers are currently less expensive and less effective compared to DR in predicting UPJO. In future, biomarker panel is likely to be more cost-effective and reduce the need for invasive renogram thus reducing the radiation exposure.",cem
11178649,Wright SJ,A structured process for the validation of a decision-analytic model: application to a cost-effectiveness model for risk-stratified national breast screening,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,2024,"- Background: Decision-makers require knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of decision-analytic models used to evaluate healthcare interventions to be able to confidently use the results of such models to inform policy. A number of aspects of model validity have previously been described, but no systematic approach to assessing the validity of a model has been proposed. This study aimed to consolidate the different aspects of model validity into a step-by-step approach to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of a decision-analytic model. Methods: A pre-defined set of steps were used to conduct the validation process of an exemplar early decision-analytic-model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programme [UK healthcare perspective; lifetime horizon; costs (£; 2021)]. Internal validation was assessed in terms of descriptive validity, technical validity and face validity. External validation was assessed in terms of operational validation, convergent validity (or corroboration) and predictive validity. Results: The results outline the findings of each step of internal and external validation of the early decision-analytic-model and present the validated model (called ‘MANC-RISK-SCREEN’). The positive aspects in terms of meeting internal validation requirements are shown together with the remaining limitations of MANC-RISK-SCREEN. Conclusion: Following a transparent and structured validation process, MANC-RISK-SCREEN has been shown to have satisfactory internal and external validity for use in informing resource allocation decision-making. We suggest that MANC-RISK-SCREEN can be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of exemplars of risk-stratified national breast cancer screening programmes (NBSP) from the UK perspective. Implications: A step-by-step process for conducting the validation of a decision-analytic model was developed for future use by health economists. Using this approach may help researchers to fully demonstrate the strengths and limitations of their model to decision-makers.

11812765,Pigeolet M,"Cost-effectiveness of screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip in Karachi, Pakistan using a universally applicable cost-effectiveness model",BMJ Public Health,2024,"- Introduction: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital anomaly of the hip socket that can lead to lifelong disability and pain when left untreated. DDH is a good candidate for screening because of its high frequency in population, availability of treatment and the possibility of secondary prevention. Pakistan currently does not have any systematic or universal neonatal screening programme for DDH. Methods: The cost-effectiveness model in this study uses one decision tree for each screening scenario: (1) the status quo, (2) universal screening by clinical examination, (3) universal screening by clinical examination with targeted ultrasound (US) screening, (4) and universal screening by US. Loss of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) is used as outcome variable. Results: When left untreated DDH creates a loss of 3.4 DALYs per person. Clinical examination and targeted US averts most DALYs per dollar spent. Generalised US averts more DALYs overall but requires a greater financial investment per DALY averted. Conclusions: Universal US screening reaches more children and can be considered the more equitable approach but requires 10 times the financial investment clinical examination and targeted US requires. The decision which option is most appropriate for Karachi, Pakistan depends on resource availability, geography, infrastructure, treatment capacity, health system values and societal factors in Pakistan.",cem
11910135,Holtmaat K,Efficacy and Budget Impact of a Tailored Psychological Intervention Program Targeting Cancer Patients With Adjustment Disorder: A Randomised Controlled Trial,Psychooncology,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Evidence on the efficacy of psychological interventions targeting cancer patients diagnosed with an adjustment disorder is scarce. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and budget impact of a tailored psychological intervention program (AD-program) targeting cancer patients with adjustment disorder (AD). METHODS: Patients (n = 59) were randomised to the intervention or control group. The AD-program consisted of three modules: psychoeducation (1-4 sessions) and two additional modules (maximum of 6 sessions per module) provided when needed. The primary outcome was psychological distress (HADS). Secondary outcomes were mental adjustment to cancer (MAC) and health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30). Measures were completed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomisation. The budget impact analyses were based on the population size, the costs of the AD-program, and other costs potentially affected by the AD-program. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score in the intervention group (n = 33) decreased over time (M = 19.2 at T0, M = 15.6 at T6). This decrease was not significantly different from decrease in the control condition (n = 26, M = 17.5 at T0, M = 15.9 at T6, p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the two conditions on the secondary outcomes. The budget impact of the AD-program was estimated at 7-28 million euros per year (to treat 14,430 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the AD-program was not statistically significant in this RCT. Limitations include that this study was underpowered due to recruitment difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. More research on the efficacy and implementation of the AD-program is warranted.

11881394,Goudarzi Z,Value of cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment for Lennox Gastaut syndrome: cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,BMC Med,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a severe encephalopathic disease that leads to a decrease in the quality of life, physical injury, psychosocial impairment, and a significant increase in treatment costs. Cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for the adjunctive treatment of tonic-colonic seizures in LGS. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of CBD compared to the usual treatment in patients with LGS syndrome. METHODS: We developed a lifetime-horizon Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive CBD versus usual care. Additionally, we performed a budget impact analysis over a 5-year time horizon. The findings were presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CEA, with a willingness to pay threshold of $18,261 per QALY gained, and as the difference in the overall budget ($) between the scenarios with and without CBD for budget impact assessment. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, CBD was cost-effective compared with usual care $6573 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses substantiated these results. From a healthcare perspective, there is a 77% probability that CBD is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $18,261 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Overall, the market access of CBD was associated to an increased budget of about $3,459,846 (+ 33%) in the next 5 years simulated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to usual care, CBD seems to be cost-effective in LGS patients and sustainable, with less than 34% overall budget increased in the next 5 years. Future studies need to confirm our results in the real word setting and in other countries.",bim
11871816,Goudarzi Z,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of rivaroxaban with or without aspirin compared to aspirin alone in patients with coronary and peripheral artery diseases in Iran,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- Background: Low-dose aspirin and rivaroxaban are the cornerstone treatment for cardiovascular prevention in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or stable coronary artery disease (SCAD). The combination of rivaroxaban with aspirin imposes a synergistic effect on the inhibition of factor-induced platelet aggregation. The present work aimed at comparing the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban alone (5 mg twice daily) with aspirin alone in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or coronary artery disease (CAD) and related subgroups. Methods: This pharmacoeconomic study was performed based on the insurance organization and utilized a state-transition decision Markov model. From the COMPASS trial, Clinical efficacy and Clinical events were collected. Health outcomes and cost were assessed over a 20-year time horizon (lifetime). The direct costs of medical services were included in the analysis. The results were stated based on Incremental Cost-Utility (ICUR) and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was assessed utilizing deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Discount rates of .058 and .03 were included for cost and effectiveness data, respectively. The budget impact based on the Markov model was estimated as the financial burden resulting from the insurance coverage of rivaroxaban. Results: In the total of CAD and PAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were more expensive than the aspirin alone, but also more effective, resulting in ICUR being $4594/QALY and $13601/QALY respectively, and for ICER being $3348/LYG and $9901/LYG. In PAD patients rivaroxaban plus aspirin had higher effectiveness than aspirin alone that ICUR and ICER being $11929/QALY and $9896/LYG respectively. In CAD patients, treatment with rivaroxaban plus aspirin was expensive and less effective than aspirin alone. The estimated annual budget impact was $28,253,135 for the rivaroxaban plus aspirin and $292,593,909 for the rivaroxaban alone in the total of CAD and PAD patients. Conclusions: This study showed that rivaroxaban plus aspirin is a cost-effective alternative in PAD and total of CAD and PAD patients. In CAD patients, rivaroxaban plus aspirin and rivaroxaban alone were not cost-effective.",bim
12037965,Briggs AH,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Daridorexant for the Pharmacological Treatment of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in Adults,Pharmacoecon Open,2025,"- OBJECTIVE: Daridorexant 50 mg is recommended for treating chronic insomnia in England, Wales (NICE, 2023) and Scotland (Scottish Medicines Consortium, 2024). This study examines the model and cost-effectiveness profile that led to these positive reimbursements. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness model integrated data from daridorexant 50 mg phase III trials (studies 301 and 303) and the National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS). Clinical parameters were the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score and adverse events. Using the NHWS, ISI data were mapped to utility, healthcare resource use, and work productivity. Daridorexant 50 mg was priced at £1.40/day. The base-case time horizon was 1 year. A lifetime model explored long-term effects. Parameters, data inputs, structural uncertainty, and alternative scenarios are all presented. RESULTS: In the 12-months model compared with placebo, daridorexant was estimated to have an incremental cost of £389 and generate an additional 0.024 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £16,300 per additional QALY from a health service perspective. Due to selective attrition, the ICER improved to £9580 per QALY for those continuing treatment for >12 months. Adopting a societal productivity perspective, daridorexant was estimated to offer £596 (£330-£896) total productivity savings versus £411/year in treatment costs, leading to a situation of dominance. Lifetime modeling improved the long-term cost effectiveness of daridorexant under the assumption that any waning of treatment effect led to further dropout. CONCLUSION: Daridorexant 50 mg is estimated to be a cost-effective pharmacological treatment for chronic insomnia disorder in adult patients.",cem
11927220,Maphanga B,The budget impact analysis of nicotine replacement therapy among patients who smoke tobacco and have mental illness in South Africa and the implications,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of death, with the highest burden in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Those who have mental illness are particularly vulnerable, with a smoking rate two to five times higher than that of the general population. Quitting smoking has demonstrated benefits for mental health, including reducing stress and improving the quality of life. However, the economic feasibility of introducing Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in the psychiatric medical environment in South Africa has not yet been explored. This study aims to address this gap by assessing the impact on the budget of implementing an NRT-based smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study followed a budget impact analysis framework. Data were retrieved between May 19 and Aug 18, 2023, from 214 patients' medical records. Using primary and secondary data, an ingredients costing approach was used to estimate direct treatment costs of NRT smoking cessation. All costs were expressed in ZAR (South African currency). The economic evaluation was conducted from the payer's perspective, and the results were reported at a 5% discount rate. A two-way 10% sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The study showed that study participants were primarily black, male, unemployed, diagnosed with schizophrenia and smoked lightly (69.16% ±3.46). Implementing the 3-month treatment period of NRT smoking cessation program would result in an expenditure of R1 478 915.42 for 214 patients. The hospital will require an additional 0.15% (±0.0095) of the total hospital budget and 6.09% (±0.31) of the hospital pharmacy budget. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that while implementing a NRT is crucial for improving the overall health outcomes among patients with mental illnesses, substantial investment would be required. The budgetary allocation for NRT smoking cessation interventions would vary by treatment settings and program duration. Consequently, careful consideration of budget allocation and resource distribution is necessary to ensure the program's sustainability within the broader healthcare framework in South Africa.",bim
11884430,Samacá-Samacá D,Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of the Use of Faricimab in Diabetic Macular Edema and Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Colombia,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Retinal diseases are major contributors to disability, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. Diabetic macular edema (DME) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) represent a significant disease and economic burden in Colombia. Assessing the economic evaluation of available treatments is essential for the efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using faricimab for the treatment of patients with DME and nAMD within the Colombian health system. Methods: This study used a 25-year Markov cohort model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of faricimab vs aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab. We used the methodological guidelines of the local health technology assessment agency for conducting the cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. Transition probabilities and injection frequencies were derived from the literature. Drug prices were retrieved from public local databases. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. The potential patient population for the budget impact analysis was estimated based on disease prevalence and expert consultations. Results: Faricimab treat-and-extend (T&E) was dominant vs aflibercept T&E (+0.22 QALYs), ranibizumab T&E (+0.55 QALYs), and brolucizumab for 8 to 12 weeks (+0.06 QALYs) in DME, generating cost savings (in US dollars) of 3849,  1375, and 2824, respectively.InnAMD, faricimabalsoshoweddominancevsafliberceptasneeded( + 0.12QALYs), ranibizumabasneeded( + 0.05QALYs), andbrolucizumab8to12weeks( + 0.12QALYs)withsavingsin(US) 7223, 5792, and 6798, respectively.

Faricimab provides better health outcomes at lower costs vs other treatments.",bim
12043813,Luckham K,A Markov model assessing the cost-effectiveness of various anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and panretinal photocoagulation for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy,Eye (Lond),2025,"- BACKGROUND: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) may lead to vision loss and blindness. The cost-effectiveness of various anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) was assessed to supplement the NICE guideline for treating PDR. METHODS: A Markov model including eight levels of visual acuity (ranged between >85 and ≤25 letters) was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab, aflibercept and bevacizumab with PRP (alone or in combination). Clinical inputs in the model were based on literature, while a published network meta-analysis (NMA) informed visual outcomes. Costs were estimated from a UK NHS perspective. RESULTS: Assuming initial treatment effects from the NMA continued to be applied for the remainder of lifetime, the probabilistic analysis resulted in bevacizumab plus PRP producing the highest net monetary benefit (NMB [95% CI]) of £221,374 [£203,941-£238,388] at £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. However, assuming initial treatment effects stabilised over time resulted in PRP alone producing the highest NMB of £223,416 [£209,318-£236,866]. Results were associated with large uncertainty due to wide confidence intervals around vision-based treatment effects of anti-VEGFs versus PRP, particularly for bevacizumab as data were drawn from trials with small sample size and high risk of bias. Using confidential prices for aflibercept and ranibizumab did not change the overall findings. CONCLUSIONS: PRP is likely to be more cost-effective than anti-VEGFs for PDR. However, the results should be interpreted with caution given the scarcity of long-term visual outcomes with anti-VEGFs in this population. Further research on long-term visual outcomes may resolve these uncertainties.",cem
10635953,Gal P,De Novo Cost-Effectiveness Model Framework for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis—Modeling Approach and Validation,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease associated with hepatic morbidity and mortality and extra-hepatic comorbidities. Published NASH cost-effectiveness models (CEMs) are heterogeneous and consistently omit comorbid conditions that frequently co-exist alongside NASH. We aimed to develop a de novo CEM framework that incorporates extra-hepatic disease states and outcomes alongside hepatic components to enable future estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions. Methods: Patient-level simulation and cohort-level Markov models were implemented in the same framework. Model inputs included fibrosis progression; late-stage liver disease outcomes; comorbidity outcomes for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity; mortality; health-related quality of life; and direct medical costs. The prototype analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of obeticholic acid versus standard of care from a US payer perspective over a lifetime horizon with costs and effects discounted at 3% per annum. However, the CEM was designed for easy adaptation to other countries, time horizons, and other considerations. Efficacy and adverse event parameters were obtained from the 18-month interim analysis of the REGENERATE trial. Outputs include total and incremental costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years. Results: In this model, total costs, total life years, and quality-adjusted life years were all higher with obeticholic acid compared with standard of care. Cross-validation of this model with the 2016 and 2020 Institute for Clinical and Economic Review models revealed marked differences, mainly driven by mortality inputs, transition probability estimates, and incorporation of the effect of treatment and comorbidities. Conclusion: This is the first CEM in NASH to incorporate the clinical consequences of several comorbidities. The flexible yet standardized framework permits estimation of the cost-effectiveness of NASH interventions in a variety of settings. The model currently includes several assumptions and will be further developed as more relevant data become available.

11919128,Gómez-Barrera M,Nurse-Led Telephone Program for Nonadherent to Treatment Type 2 Diabetics With Comorbid Depression: A Cost-Consequence and Budget Impact Analysis,J Nurs Manag,2024,"- Objective: To estimate the efficiency of a nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent to treatment Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression (TELE-DD program). Design: Secondary analysis of cost-consequence and budget impact, utilizing data from a randomized clinical trial conducted in the primary healthcare setting. The target population consisted of Type 2 diabetic patients with comorbid depression who were nonadherent to their pharmacological treatment. Method: The average cost per controlled patient (glycated hemoglobin < 7%) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Similarly, the budgetary impact over 1 year of implementing this program in the region of reference of the randomized clinical trial was assessed. Results: The number of controlled patients is higher in the TELE-DD group at 6, 12, and 18 months. The average cost per controlled patient was higher in the TELE-DD group than in the control group at 6 months (€160.31 vs. €49.79), but lower at 12 (€150.09 vs. €179.59) and 18 months (€209.22 vs. €376.88). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 6, 12, and 18 months was €254.47, €143.65, and €177.46, respectively. The budget impact analysis revealed that implementing the TELE-DD program would result in a reduction of €721,940.68 in expenditure for the funder in the first year of application. Conclusions: A nurse-led telephone program for nonadherent Type 2 diabetics with comorbid depression is an efficient option in the management of healthcare resources. These results highlight the role of nursing in chronic patient management and the efficient use of healthcare resources. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04097483.",bim
12017058,Wang F,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Hepatitis E Vaccination Strategies for Swine Workers,Transbound Emerg Dis,2025,"- Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in China, with swine as the most common reservoir. It poses a zoonotic public health risk to swine workers. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination for this high-risk group in China. A decision tree-Markov model was utilized to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two hepatitis E vaccination strategies, without or following screening, for swine workers aged 16-60 in China from societal perspectives, compared to no vaccination. We calculated HEV-related cases and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of GDP per capita. A sensitivity analysis was conducted. Additionally, we stimulated the scenarios of fully receiving 3-dose schedule, partially receiving 3-dose schedule, and fully receiving 2-dose schedule. Both hepatitis E vaccination strategies significantly reduced HEV-related cases and deaths compared to no vaccination. ICERs were estimated to be USD 11,428.16 and 9830.71/QALY averted for vaccination without and following screening, respectively, both lower than GDP per capita (USD 12,325.24, 2023). Furthermore, one-way sensitivity analysis identified the discount rate, utility in asymptomatic cases, and probability of symptomatic infection as crucial factors affecting ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed a 47.5% cost-effectiveness probability for hepatitis E vaccination following screening, compared to 52.5% for no vaccination. Notably, vaccination following screening was cost-ineffective after age 40 and at a price of USD 138.0/dose. Additionally, fully receiving 2-dose and partially 3-dose schedules were cost-effective, regardless of hepatitis E vaccination without or following screening strategies, while fully receiving 3-dose schedule was cost-ineffective with the vaccination without screening strategy. Hepatitis E vaccination following screening would be optimal for swine workers in China. Vaccination starting at an earlier age and lower vaccine prices can improve the cost-effectiveness. Additionally, 2-dose schedule may be recommended during a hepatitis E outbreak to achieve cost-effectiveness.",cem
11849414,Siegfried C,Using QIP-MS to Guide the Timing of MRD Testing in Patients With Multiple Myeloma: A Budget Impact Analysis From the French Payer Perspective,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2025,"- Purpose: Serum or urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP or UPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE or UIFE) are routinely used to detect M-proteins in MM patients. However, SPEP and SIFE are not sensitive enough to measure M-protein levels that are low but still clinically significant. This study aimed to evaluate the potential cost savings associated with using the EXENT GAM Assay, a serum-based quantitative-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (QIP-MS) diagnostic test instead of SIFE to guide the timing of minimal residual disease (MRD) testing for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Patients and Methods: A simple 2-year budget impact model was created in Excel using data from MM clinical trials and fee schedules. Patients are tested with either QIP-MS or SIFE at predetermined timepoints. If patients test negative, they will receive MRD testing. The result of the MRD test will determine if the preceding serum-based test was a true negative result (MRD test is negative) or a false negative result (MRD test is positive). Patients receiving autologous stem cell transplant (henceforth referred to as transplant) and those not receiving transplant are both eligible for one MRD test per year. MRD testing for transplant-eligible patients occurs prior to transplant and one year following transplant. Results: Across a hypothetical population of 5154 mm patients receiving 1st-line treatment in France, using QIP-MS instead of SIFE prior to MRD testing leads to 1973 fewer false negative results and 744 more false positive results (due, in part, to the detection of residual IgG). Net savings per QIP-MS test would be €260 or total savings of €2,481,832. Conclusion: This study suggests that the use of QIP-MS prior to MRD testing may be cost-saving for testing French patients with MM.",bim
11936304,McCullough HP,"The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation mHealth Intervention for People Experiencing Homelessness: Cost Analysis, Exploratory Financial Cost-Benefit Analysis, and Budget Impact Analysis",JMIR Form Res,2025,"- BACKGROUND: The Interactive Care Coordination and Navigation (iCAN) mobile health intervention aims to improve care coordination and reduce hospital and emergency department visits among people experiencing homelessness. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a three-part economic evaluation of iCAN, including a (1) cost analysis, (2) exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis, and (3) budget impact analysis (BIA). METHODS: We collected cost and expenditure data from a randomized controlled trial of iCAN to conduct a cost analysis and exploratory financial cost-benefit analysis. Costs were classified as startup and recurring costs for participants and the program. Startup costs included participant supplies for each participant and SMS implementation costs. Recurring costs included the cost of recurring services, SMS text messaging platform maintenance, health information access fees, and personnel salaries. Using the per participant per year (PPPY) costs of iCAN, the minimum savings reduction in the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness that would lead to a benefit-cost ratio >1 for iCAN was calculated. This savings threshold was calculated by dividing the PPPY cost of iCAN by the average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness multiplied by 100%. The benefit-cost ratio of iCAN was calculated under different savings thresholds from 0% (no savings) to 50%. Costs were calculated PPPY under different scenarios, and the results were used as inputs in a BIA. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate uncertainty around cost estimates. Costs are in 2022 US $. RESULTS: The total cost of iCAN was US $2865 PPPY, which was made up of US $265 in startup (9%) and US $2600 (91%) in recurring costs PPPY. The minimum savings threshold that would cause iCAN to have a positive return on investment is 7.8%. This means that if average health care costs (US $36,917) among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. When health care costs are reduced by 25% ($9229/$36,917; equal to 56% [$9229/$16,609] of the average cost of an inpatient visit), the benefit-cost ratio is 3.22, which means that iCAN produces US $2.22 in health care savings per US $1 spent. The BIA estimated that implementing iCAN for 10,250 people experiencing homelessness over 5 years would have a financial cost of US $28.7 million, which could be reduced to US $2.2 million if at least 8% ($2880/$36,917) of average health care costs among people experiencing homelessness are reduced through the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: If average costs of emergency department and hospital visits among people experiencing homelessness were reduced by more than 7.8% ($2880/$36,917) through iCAN, the financial benefits would outweigh the costs of the intervention. As the savings threshold increases, it results in a higher benefit-cost ratio.",bim
11953859,Shafrin J,Economic impact of sotagliflozin among patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes: Budget impact analysis from the US payer perspective,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality in the United States, often complicated by comorbidities like diabetes mellitus. These patients face high hospitalization risks, impacting clinical outcomes and health care resources. The Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that sotagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor, reduced rehospitalizations in patients with HF and diabetes mellitus. Although clinically beneficial, the economic impact of sotagliflozin from a payer perspective remains unclear, warranting further pharmacoeconomic analysis to guide managed care decisions. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the budget impact of sotagliflozin for US payers over a 5-year time horizon. METHODS: A payer-perspective budget impact model was developed to assess the financial impact of incorporating sotagliflozin for the treatment of patients recently hospitalized for HF with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2D) over 5 years to US payer health plans. The study used a population reflecting the SOLOIST-WHF clinical trial, with economic parameters adjusted by payer mix (all payer, commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid). Health care resource utilization included hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visit, and adverse events' care. Economic outcomes examined the medical and pharmacy budget impact for payers at the per-user, per member per month (PMPM), and total plan costs levels. RESULTS: For a hypothetical 1-million-member all-payer plan, 1,516 patients hospitalized for HF with comorbid T2D would be eligible for sotagliflozin. For all-payer plans, annual per-user costs increased by $4,996 because of higher pharmacy costs ($8,260) but were partially offset by lower medical costs (-$2,608) because of reduced rehospitalization and ED visits from sotagliflozin. PMPM total budget impact of sotagliflozin would be $0.08 PMPM in year 1 and $0.38 in year 5, corresponding with total plan cost of $75,736 in year 1 and $378,681 by year 5. Commercial payer PMPM costs were lower ($0.02 in year 1; $0.11 in year 5), and higher for Medicare ($0.23 PMPM in year 1, increasing to 1.13 PMPM in year 5). Breakeven rebate rates ranged between 31.5% and 79.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Although sotagliflozin increases pharmacy costs for recently hospitalized HF patients with T2D, approximately 21%-68% of pharmacy costs were offset from reduced rehospitalization and ED visits.",bim

In Spain, estimates suggest that the direct healthcare costs of CKD will increase by 13.8% from 2022, which is why the cost of kidney replacement treatment (KRT) programs efficiency and sustainability is under constant analysis. Our analysis aimed to estimate the cost associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to hemodialysis (HD) from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective and to evaluate the budgetary impact of an increase in the use of PD in our healthcare system environment. METHODS: The number of patients eligible for KRT was calculated based on the total Spanish population and the incidence and prevalence of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients receiving each modality, type of dialysis, and location of dialysis were estimated. The annual costs of each dialysis modality were calculated and included the cost of dialysis sessions and additional costs (including the cost of peritoneal and vascular access, hospitalisation costs due to potential complications of dialysis, cost of health care personnel, and cost of health care transport used by patients). Population data and costs (€, 2024) were obtained from the Spanish databases and a nephrologist validated the assumptions. Budget impact analysis assessed the incremental budget impact between the current scenario and the alternative scenario, where 30% of incident patients on scheduled HD would receive PD. RESULTS: We estimated that in Spain, there are 27,281 prevalent dialysis patients (3,141 receiving PD and 24,140 receiving HD/HDF) and 6,052 incident dialysis patients (1,173 receiving PD and 4,879 HD/HDF). The cost of dialysis amount to €1,555,573,771 (€141,361,374 PD and €1,414,212,397 to HD) in the current scenarios and to €1,540,584,011 (€167,593,157 PD and €1,372,990,854 HD) in the alternative scenario, resulting in a saving of €14,989,760 when 30% of the patients scheduled to receive HD would instead receive PD during the first year. CONCLUSIONS: The increased use of PD in Spain improves the system's efficiency, generating significant savings in the treatment of ESRD patients from the NHS perspective.",bim
12048119,Wang KH,The prognostic implication of polymerase epsilon-mutated endometrial cancer,Tzu Chi Med J,2024,"- The traditional classification and risk stratification systems of endometrial cancer (EC), which relied on histomorphological features, were limited and poor reproducible. The classification of new molecular subtypes of EC has been developing, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-four molecular subtypes: Polymerase epsilon (POLE) mutation (POLEmut), microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy number-low, and copy number-high and ProMisE-four molecular subtypes: POLEmut, mismatch repair deficiency, no specific molecular profile, and p53 abnormal. POLEmut usually correlates with a favorable outcome. Hence, we reviewed the research since the TCGA molecular subtypes developed in 2013 and summarized the characteristics and prognosis of POLEmut EC patients. In summary, we found POLEmut occurs in 7.3%-9.6% of EC in the previous studies. POLEmut EC consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. The research of POLEmut in EC is absent in Taiwan, and the underlying mechanisms and cost-effectiveness need further investigation.",cem
12049781,Ochieng W,Bringing malaria diagnosis and treatment closer to the people: economic rationale for expanding malaria community case management to all ages in a rural district in Madagascar,Malar J,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Expanding malaria community case management (mCCM) to all ages could shift the point-of-care to the community leading to improved healthcare access in underserved populations. This study assesses the economic viability of such an expansion in Farafangana district, Madagascar. METHODS: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted across 30 health centres and the 502 community health workers (CHW) in their catchment areas, with the intervention arm implementing the age-expanded mCCM intervention. CHWs across both arms received training, supplies, and supervision to manage malaria. An economic evaluation assessed cost-effectiveness from health sector and societal perspectives, measuring outcomes in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The impact of CHW compensation and economic risks were evaluated using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Without CHW compensation, annual costs were $794,000, primarily for antimalarials and diagnostic tests. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per DALY averted ranged from -$21.86 to $212.42. From a societal perspective, the ICER was -$135.64, and -$243.29 including mortality benefits, meaning the intervention was cost-saving. The programme could avert 99.6 deaths and 3,721.7 DALYs annually, yielding $1,172,283 in net economic benefits. Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Age-expanded mCCM is highly cost-effective and can enhance malaria treatment access in resource-limited settings.",cem
12049324,Konta T,The health-economic impact of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing for chronic kidney disease in Japanese non-diabetic patients,Clin Exp Nephrol,2024,"- BACKGROUND: The objective of this analysis was to estimate the clinical and economic impact of undertaking urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) testing alongside regular estimated glomerular filtration rate testing for chronic kidney disease in non-diabetic Japanese patients versus no testing and versus urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) testing. METHODS: An economic model, taking a Japanese healthcare perspective, estimated the health-economic impact of UACR testing over a lifetime time horizon. Outcomes reported were additional costs, clinical benefits measured, such as prevented dialyses and cardiovascular events, quality-adjusted life years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Health states were derived from risk levels reported in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes heatmap. Results were derived assuming that after testing, treatment was available in the form of current standard-of-care or emerging chronic kidney disease therapies. RESULTS: Repeated UACR testing was found to be cost-effective compared to both no urine testing and UPCR testing, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ¥1,953,958 and ¥1,966,433, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, this model demonstrates the health-economic value of undertaking UACR testing within the non-diabetic Japanese population.",cem
12049664,Kumar S,Evaluating the Impact of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) Training in Reducing Preventable and Potentially Preventable Deaths: A Mixed-Methods Cohort Study,Cureus,2025,"- Background Trauma remains a leading global cause of mortality, particularly in low-resource settings. Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) training offers a standardized approach to trauma care, yet its impact in India remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ATLS training in reducing preventable trauma-related deaths and improving clinical decision-making at a tertiary care center in Bihar, India. Methods This mixed-methods cohort study was conducted from October 2021 to December 2024 and included 200 trauma patients aged ≥18 years. Patients were divided into two groups: pre-ATLS (retrospective; October 2021 to July 2024) and post-ATLS (prospective; August 2024 to December 2024). Mortality rates, trauma management errors, and survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, chi-square tests, logistic regression models, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Additionally, structured interviews with healthcare providers supplemented the quantitative findings. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software, Version 4.1.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with significance set at p < 0.05. Results ATLS training significantly reduced preventable deaths (from 30% to 15%) and potentially preventable deaths (from 40% to 25%). Trauma management errors, including delayed diagnoses and protocol deviations, also decreased post-training. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved survival, while Cox regression identified ATLS training as an independent predictor of survival (HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.85, p = 0.003). Healthcare providers reported greater confidence in trauma assessment but highlighted concerns regarding accessibility, cost, and the need for refresher courses. Conclusions ATLS training enhances trauma care by reducing preventable mortality, minimizing errors, and boosting provider confidence. Expanding ATLS programs, particularly in resource-limited settings, is recommended. Future research should focus on long-term patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of ATLS implementation.",cem
12050136,Nwankwo H,Cost utility analysis of acute rehabilitation approaches in the management of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation,Bone Jt Open,2025,"- AIMS: We aimed to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing one session of advice, supporting materials, and option to self-refer to physiotherapy with the same advice and materials, plus an additional programme of physiotherapy for people with a first-time, traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation within a randomized controlled trial from the UK NHS and personal social services (PSS) perspective. Resources used, and health-related quality of life information, were collected as part of the Acute Rehabilitation following Traumatic anterior shoulder dISlocAtioN (ARTISAN) randomized controlled trial over a 12-month period using patient-completed questionnaires. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued over the follow-up period were calculated and expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Estimate uncertainty was explored by bootstrapping and graphically displayed on the ICER plane. Net monetary benefits, probability of cost-effectiveness, and expected value of perfect information were explored at a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds and visualized graphically. RESULTS: Over a 12-month time horizon, incremental costs were £64 (95% CI -61 to 191) and incremental QALYs were 0.019 (95% CI -0.0005 to 0.0375) for the additional programme of physiotherapy. The ICER was £3,373/QALY, suggesting that the programme is cost-effective, although the primary outcome (Oxford Shoulder Instability Score) found little difference six months after a shoulder dislocation. The probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY is 95%. Findings need to interpreted with caution given the high rates of missing data at 12 months, due to the final 12-month follow-up being curtailed during the trial. However, the range of sensitivity analyses supports the base case findings. CONCLUSION: The within-trial economic evaluation found that the additional physiotherapy programme is likely to be cost-effective. However, given the small and imprecise health gains, the best use of scarce physiotherapy resources needs careful consideration given other current demands on services.",cem
12002750,Yin Y,Modeling the distribution of the invasive snail Physella acuta in China: Implications for ecological and economic impact,Sci One Health,2025,"- BACKGROUND: The invasive freshwater snail Physella acuta poses significant threats to the ecological environment, public health safety, and the agricultural and forestry economy. Gaining insight into their geographical spread in China under current and future climate scenarios is crucial for effective monitoring and control strategies against this invasive species. METHODS: Global distribution data of P. acuta were collected and screened using ""ENMtool""; environmental variables were screened based on contribution of environmental variables, jackknife test and variable correlation analysis using MaxEnt 3.4.1 and GraphPad Prism 8; ""kuenm"" package in R 4.0.4 software was used to calculate and adjust model parameters; the optimized MaxEnt model was used to predict the potential distribution range of P. acuta in China under different climate scenarios; ArcGIS 10.7 was used to process and visualize the results. RESULTS: A total of 2012 P. acuta distribution points were screened, and the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest season, precipitation in March and November were used to construct the MaxEnt model with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.918. According to the prediction, P. acuta is currently widely spread across the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guizhou Province, Yunnan Province, Chongqing Municipality, and areas proximate to the Yangtze River Basin in the middle-lower Yangtze Plain, which encompass 10.22 % of China's terrestrial area. Under future climate projections, the suitable habitats for P. acuta in southern regions are expected to contract, whereas those in northern regions are anticipated to remain relatively stable. As a result, the overall distribution center is likely to shift marginally northward. CONCLUSION: With the future climate change, the total suitable habitats of P. acuta in China showed a shrinking trend, and the shrinkage was more significant in the southern low-latitude suitable habitats. To mitigate its impact on China's ecosystem and the loss caused by P. acuta invasion, relevant departments should increase monitoring and prompt control, and implement efficient preventive and eradication measures.",bim

12046533,Atherly DE,Projected health and economic impact of rotavirus vaccination in GAVI-eligible countries: 2011 – 2030,Vaccine,2012,"- Rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrheal disease in children under 5 years of age. It is responsible for more than 450,000 deaths each year, with more than 90% of these deaths occurring in low-resource countries eligible for support by the GAVI Alliance. Significant efforts made by the Alliance and its partners are providing countries with the opportunity to introduce rotavirus vaccines into their national immunization programs, to help prevent childhood illness and death. We projected the cost-effectiveness and health impact of rotavirus vaccines in GAVI-eligible countries, to assist decision makers in prioritizing resources to achieve the greatest health benefits for their populations. A decision-analytic model was used to project the health outcomes and direct costs of a birth cohort in the target population, with and without a rotavirus vaccine. Current data on disease burden, vaccine efficacy, immunization rates, and costs were used in the model. Vaccination in GAVI-eligible countries would prevent 2.46 million childhood deaths and 83 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 2011 to 2030, with annual reductions of 180,000 childhood deaths at peak vaccine uptake. The cost per DALY averted is $42 for all GAVI countries combined, over the entire period. Rotavirus vaccination would be considered very cost-effective for the entire cohort of GAVI countries, and in each country individually, as cost-effectiveness ratios are less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Vaccination is most cost-effective and has the greatest impact in regions with high rotavirus mortality. Rotavirus vaccination in GAVI-eligible countries is very cost-effective and is projected to substantially reduce childhood mortality in this population.",bim
12017669,Roy A,"Morbidity Profile, Economic Impact, and Social Security Scheme Utilisation of Occupational Injuries in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Bangalore, Karnataka",Indian J Occup Environ Med,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Occupational injuries pose a critical challenge amid India's rapid industrialization. National Programme on Occupational Diseases Quadrant I reports alarming global statistics, with India contributing significantly to the burden. Injuries impose a significant financial burden on individual households, leading to substantial out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPE) causing severe financial distress for the families of the victims. This study explores the profile and economic ramifications of such injuries, emphasizing the urgent need for intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed methods study, conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore, Karnataka, analyses data from 148 occupational injury cases over 6 months. Ethical approval was obtained, and data were collected from hospital records and direct patient inquiries. Demographics, injury characteristics, root causes, and outcomes were analyzed. The economic burden, catastrophic health expenditure, awareness, and utilization of social security schemes (SSS) were assessed. RESULTS: A predominant demographic vulnerability exists among workers under 25 years old, especially in high-risk sectors. Traumatic injuries, primarily due to employee negligence, are prevalent, with extremity injuries and ocular injuries being common. While 68.9% of participants claimed access to personal protective equipment (PPE) at their work sites, only 51.4% reported actual usage of PPE. A significant financial strain was observed, with 64 out of 148 participants experiencing catastrophic health expenditure. Insurance coverage and SSS utilization are limited, indicating gaps in awareness and procedural complexities. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, particularly in high-risk sectors and during vulnerable periods, such as postlunch hours. Bridging the gap between PPE availability and utilization is crucial. The study emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between regulatory bodies, employers, and workers to enhance safety measures. Furthermore, it highlights the challenges and successes in SSS utilization, suggesting the need for streamlined processes and increased awareness campaigns. Recommendations include targeted interventions, safety training, and streamlined SSS processes to address the complexities surrounding workplace incidents and improve overall occupational well-being. Continued research is crucial to refining preventive strategies and mitigating the impact of occupational injuries. CONCLUSION: This study reveals the urgent need for improved safety measures and streamlined social security schemes to mitigate the significant economic burden of occupational injuries in India.",bim
12031038,Jung J,Estimating the Public Health and Economic Impact of Annual mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination for Adults Aged 50 and Older in South Korea’s Endemic Era,Vaccines (Basel),2025,"- Background/Objectives: COVID-19 continues to challenge public health due to emerging variants. To mitigate this, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) recommends annual COVID-19 vaccination, but uptake remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the public health and economic impact of annual mRNA COVID-19 vaccination for adults aged 50 and older in South Korea during the 2024–2025 season, focusing on hospitalizations and costs. Methods: We estimated hospitalizations prevented by the mRNA-1273 XBB.1.5 containing vaccine by calculating symptomatic infection incidence rates, hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization, and vaccination rates. Incidence rates among the unvaccinated with an annual vaccine were derived by adjusting overall infection rates based on vaccination coverage and VE against COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Hospitalization costs were obtained from a real-world dataset, integrating the KDCA’s COVID-19 confirmed cases with National Health Insurance claims data. Comparative analyses between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 used published meta-analysis results. Results: Assuming vaccination rates remain consistent with the 2023–2024 season, mRNA-1273 is projected to prevent 37,200 hospitalizations and save USD 77.2 million in healthcare costs during the 2024–2025 season compared to no annual vaccination. Compared to BNT162b2, it is expected to prevent an additional 13,260 hospitalizations saving USD 27.5 million. If vaccination rates increased to match influenza, hospitalizations prevented by mRNA-1273 could rise to 79,800 with USD 164.2 million in healthcare savings compared to no annual vaccination. Conclusion: Annual mRNA COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 substantially reduces hospitalizations and healthcare costs. Increasing vaccination rates are essential to maximize public health benefits.",bim
12025344,Patel MS,Optimization and Economic Impact of Expedited Minimally Invasive Parafascicular Surgery (MIPS) Protocol for Spontaneous Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage,Cureus,2025,"- Background Minimally invasive parafascicular surgery (MIPS) for evacuating intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has proven to be an effective treatment compared to medical management. At our academic center, we have adopted a strategy of early surgery (<12 hours) and aimed to assess its impact on patients undergoing MIPS from an economic standpoint. This study introduces an innovative preoperative protocol to reduce costs and improve efficiency in the healthcare setting for patients undergoing ICH evacuation. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients who underwent MIPS for spontaneous ICH evacuation between 2014 and 2017. The patients were stratified into two groups: expedited versus control and early versus late operation. The expedited protocol involved using either computed tomography angiography (CTA) or a stereotactic head CT for guidance during the operation.  Results Nine patients were included in the expedited protocol group, where they were taken from the emergency department (ED) for CT and CTA, followed by a surgical decision, and then directly to the operating room (OR) from the imaging center. Nine patients were included in the control group, where they were taken from the ED for CT and CTA and returned to the ED, followed by a surgical decision, then to the imaging center for a stereotactic CTH for intraoperative navigation, and then to the OR. Additionally, eleven patients were in the early operation group, and seven were in the late operation group. The mean time from ED admission to surgery was 8.2 hours for the early operation group and 62.2 hours for the late operation group (p = 0.10). The control group had 38 preoperative scans, while the expedited group had 17. The mean preoperative imaging cost decreased from $2,039 in the control to $1,003 in the expedited group (p = 0.004). Similarly, the mean preoperative imaging cost was $2,061 for the late operation group and $1,162 for the early operation group, respectively (p = 0.02). There was a 15% decrease in the postoperative hospital stay cost per patient (p > 0.05). Conclusion Patients undergoing an expedited preoperative protocol and early surgery experienced a statistically significant reduction in preoperative costs and a shorter time between ED admission and surgery. The expedited protocol may provide economic relief for patients undergoing MIPS without compromising outcomes.",bim
11630598,Noparatayaporn P,Cost-utility and budget impact analysis of laparoscopic bariatric surgery for obesity with Type II Diabetes Mellitus in Thailand,PLoS One,2024,"- Bariatric surgery is another treatment options for patients with obesity, who cannot achieve weight controlled by conservative non-surgical therapy. Although bariatric surgery provides clinical benefits for these patients, it is costly. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery, as compared to nonbariatric surgery, in patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥32.5 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to estimate the budget impact of bariatric surgery in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate and compare total costs incurred and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained between bariatric surgery and nonbariatric surgery over lifetime horizontal. Analysis was conducted under payer and societal perspectives. Costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The outcomes were presented as incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Under payer's perspective, bariatric surgery resulted in higher total lifetime cost (676,658.39 baht vs 574,683.38 baht) and QALYs gained (16.08 QALYs vs 14.78 QALYs), as compared to nonbariatric surgery, resulting in an ICER of 78,643.02 baht/QALY. Similarly, under the societal perspective, bariatric surgery resulted in higher total lifetime cost (1,451,923.83 baht vs 1,407,590.49 baht) and QALYs gained (16.08 QALYs vs 14.78 QALYs), as compared to nonbariatric surgery. Under societal perspective, ICER was estimated at 34,189.82 baht/QALY. A 5-year budget impact analysis indicated that bariatric surgery incurred the total budget of 223,821 million baht. CONCLUSIONS: At the cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 baht/QALY, bariatric surgery was a cost-effective strategy and should continue to be included in the benefit package for patients with obesity and T2DM.",bim

9661901,Ayres BD,Economic Impact Analysis of Custom Pak® on Cataract and Vitreoretinal Surgery in the United States,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2022,"- PURPOSE: Implicit costs of surgical preparation and materials management for cataract/anterior segment and retinal/posterior segment procedures are often unquantified. Use of ophthalmological surgical procedure packs is common in these surgeries; however, there is little in the literature demonstrating their time and cost impacts. Understanding the costs and potential benefits of surgical pack procedure use is important for administrators in purchasing decision-making. The objective of this study is to estimate the economic impact of Alcon Custom Pak(®) on cataract and vitreoretinal (retina) surgery in hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) across operating room (OR), materials management, and accounting departments. METHODS: We conducted a study in 2019 among US hospitals and ASCs using an online survey and a surgery timing exercise. Surgical technicians and supply chain managers were surveyed regarding current cataract and retina surgery practices including OR, materials management, and accounting tasks. Surgical technicians timed cataract and retina surgeries, recording activity timestamps and surgical supply use from Alcon Custom Pak and other sources. Using the survey and timing exercise inputs and literature and government sources, we developed a budget impact model (BIM) to quantify hidden costs of time and labor spent across the entire surgery supply life cycle. RESULTS: Representing a geographical mix of 99 facilities, surgical technicians (56 cataract/46 retina) and supply chain managers (23 cataract/24 retina) provided data for their institutions. Technicians timed 290 cataract and 250 retina surgeries. In the BIM, increasing baseline Custom Pak utilization to 100% of surgeries while also sourcing all relevant supplies from Custom Pak results in annual cost savings ranging from $92,273 to $217,675 across procedure type and setting, allowing for between 75 (retina ASC) and 266 (cataract hospital) potential additional procedures per facility/year. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that increasing Custom Pak usage can potentially save time, reduce hidden costs, and increase throughput.",bim
10531588,Rao C,Hemoadsorption Using CytoSorb® in Patients with Infective Endocarditis: A German-Based Budget Impact Analysis,J Cardiovasc Dev Dis,2023,"- A considerable number of infective endocarditis (IE) patients require cardiac surgery with an increased risk for postoperative sepsis. Intraoperative hemoadsorption may diminish the risk of postoperative hyperinflammation with potential economic implications for intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. The present study aimed to theoretically investigate the budget impact of a reduced length of ICU stay in IE patients treated with intraoperative hemoadsorption in the German healthcare system. Data on ICU occupation were extrapolated from a retrospective study on IE patients treated with hemoadsorption. An Excel-based budget impact model was developed to simulate the patient course over the ICU stay. A base-case scenario without therapy reimbursement and a scenario with full therapy reimbursement were explored. The annual eligible German IE patient population was derived from official German Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) volume data. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the uncertainty over the model results. The use of intraoperative hemoadsorption resulted in EUR 2298 being saved per patient in the base-case scenario without therapy reimbursement. The savings increased to EUR 3804 per patient in the case of full device-specific reimbursement. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of savings, with a probability of savings of 87% and 99% in the base-case and full reimbursement scenario, respectively. Intraoperative hemoadsorption in IE patients might have relevant economic benefits related to reduced ICU stays, resulting in improved resource use. Further evaluations in larger prospective cohorts are warranted.",bim
11718670,Seo H,OP42 A Budget Impact Analysis Of The Introduction Of Noninvasive Prenatal Testing To Korean National Health Insurance,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: This study assessed the budget impact (BI) of introducing noninvasive perinatal testing (NIPT) to the Korean National Health Insurance (KNHI). It aims to provide useful economic evidence on reimbursement decisions on prenatal screening. Since NIPT is widely used in Korea as a noncovered service, BI can be reliably estimated from real-world data (RWD). METHODS: In this BI analysis, we derived the total number of pregnant women from 2017 birth statistics (n=358,000) and its distribution of singleton births (96.1%) and multiples (3.9%). The age distribution of pregnant women was 29.4 percent for 35 and above, and 70.6 percent for below 35, according to the 2017 statistics. For NIPT costs, we considered a price range of KRW357,000 (USD260) to KRW715,000 (USD522) from a 2018 survey. To evaluate the BI of introducing NIPT, we examined eight scenarios based on NIPT cost sharing of 30 percent and 70 percent, NIPT price, and whether to include pregnant women aged less than 35 years old. RESULTS: BI for KNHI was estimated as KRW6 trillion (USD4 billion) to approximately KRW56 trillion (USD40 billion). Scenario seven, targeting older pregnant women with serum screening high risk with NIPT price at the lower end and payer coverage of 30 percent, shows the lowest annual BI of KRW6,115,813,866 (USD4,469,516); scenario two, covering all older pregnant women and younger high-risk cases with NIPT price at the higher end and payer coverage of 70 percent, exhibits the highest burden at KRW56,240,636,611 (USD41,091,993). CONCLUSIONS: Our BI analysis of introducing NIPT to KNHI can serve as essential data for estimating insurer burdens during the potential transition of NIPT to provisional or selective coverage. In the absence of prenatal diagnostics cost-effectiveness research in Korea, our findings provide crucial evidence for establishing relevant reimbursement criteria, addressing a gap in current research and supporting evidence-based policymaking.",bim
10137341,Lim VW,Budget Impact Analysis of Adopting a One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) Alone Diagnostic Pathway for Clostridioides difficile in Japan Compared to a Two-Step Algorithm with Glutamate Dehydrogenase/Toxin Followed by NAAT,Diagnostics (Basel),2023,"- Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major healthcare-associated infection that leads to a significant health economic burden in Japan. Using a decision tree model, we evaluated the budget impact of adopting a one-step nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) alone pathway compared to a two-step diagnostic algorithm with glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxin antigen, followed by NAAT. The analysis was conducted from the government payer's perspective for 100,000 symptomatic, hospitalized adults requiring a CDI diagnostic test. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted for all data inputs. The NAAT alone strategy costed JPY 225,886,360 (USD 2,424,714) more, but was more effective, resulting in 1749 more patients accurately diagnosed and 91 fewer deaths compared to the two-step algorithm. Additionally, the NAAT alone pathway costed JPY 26,146 (USD 281) less per true positive CDI diagnosed. The total budget impact, and cost per CDI diagnosed was most sensitive to GDH sensitivity in one-way sensitivity analysis, where a lower GDH sensitivity resulted in greater cost savings with the NAAT alone pathway. Findings from this budget impact analysis can guide the adoption of a NAAT alone pathway for CDI diagnosis in Japan.",bim
9640704,Jayawardana S,Feasibility of novel adult tuberculosis vaccination in South Africa: a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,NPJ Vaccines,2022,"- Early trials of novel vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) in adults have suggested substantial protection against TB. However, little is known about the feasibility and affordability of rolling out such vaccines in practice. We conducted expert interviews to identify plausible vaccination implementation strategies for the novel M72/AS01(E) vaccine candidate. The strategies were defined in terms of target population, coverage, vaccination schedule and delivery mode. We modelled these strategies to estimate long-term resource requirements and health benefits arising from vaccination over 2025-2050. We presented these to experts who excluded strategies that were deemed infeasible, and estimated cost-effectiveness and budget impact for each remaining strategy. The four strategies modelled combined target populations: either everyone aged 18-50, or all adults living with HIV, with delivery strategies: either a mass campaign followed by routine vaccination of 18-year olds, or two mass campaigns 10 years apart. Delivering two mass campaigns to all 18-50-year olds was found to be the most cost-effective strategy conferring the greatest net health benefit of 1.2 million DALYs averted having a probability of being cost-effective of 65-70%. This strategy required 38 million vaccine courses to be delivered at a cost of USD 507 million, reducing TB-related costs by USD 184 million while increasing ART costs by USD 79 million. A suitably designed adult TB vaccination programme built around novel TB vaccines is likely to be cost-effective and affordable given the resource and budget constraints in South Africa.",bim

Population screening has proven to be both effective and cost effective. When considering whether to implement screening or not, the uncertainty of the budget impact plays an important role. This study aims to develop methods that improve the accuracy of budget impact analysis for a one-time CHC screening program. METHODS: We developed a back-calculation mathematical model that employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the prevalence and proportion of undiagnosed CHC. Subsequently, we utilized a state-transition model to assess the budget impact of two strategies: (i) no screening; and (ii) screen-and-treat with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) for individuals born between 1945 and 1965 (“baby-boomer” birth cohort). Model data were gathered from published literature. Our analysis adopted a Canadian provincial payer perspective, employed a 10-year time horizon, and followed best-practice recommendations by not applying discounting. RESULTS: For individuals born between 1945 and 1965, the estimated prevalence of CHC was 1.74 percent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52, 2.30) with an undiagnosed proportion of 15.72 percent (95% CI: 11.27, 18.54). The initial budget impact analysis indicated an additional cost of CAD61.5 million (USD45.0 million) over 10 years for screening related individuals for CHC in Ontario. With these updated prevalence and undiagnosed proportion estimates, our projection suggests a 29.6 percent reduction in the budget impact, now estimated at CAD43.3 million (USD31.7 million). CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the budget impact of the CHC screening strategy with other recommended health services and technologies in Ontario, we have concluded that CHC screening may be considered affordable. To enhance the accuracy of budget impact analysis for population-level screening decision-making, it is crucial to develop precise methodologies for estimating the underlying prevalence and undiagnosed proportions.",bim
11719149,Gargano L,PD18 Cytomegalovirus Prophylaxis With Valganciclovir For HIV-Immunosuppressed Patients: Cost Effectiveness And Budget Impact Analysis From The Brazilian Healthcare System Perspective,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are usually mild but can lead to serious consequences in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Valganciclovir, which is approved for treating CMV, may be a cost-effective prophylactic for CMV disease in immunocompromised patients. Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted to compare valganciclovir prophylaxis with no prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients with HIV. METHODS: Immunosuppressed patients with HIV who were seropositive for CMV were modeled in a one-year horizon decision tree. Outcomes were occurrence of CMV end-organ disease (EOD)–retinitis and gastroenteritis (85 and 15 percent of cases, respectively)–and survival probability after EOD. Direct medical costs related to prophylaxis (induction and maintenance phases) and treatment of EOD were considered. The budget impact analysis (BIA) used the clinical and cost parameters of the cost-effectiveness analysis to compare scenarios with valganciclovir prophylaxis and no prophylaxis in the public health system over a five-year time horizon. The annual market share adoption rate used was 10 percent. The number of eligible patients was calculated from HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases reported in the country and epidemiological estimates. RESULTS: Valganciclovir prophylaxis had an incremental cost of BRL31,781 (USD6,531) and added 0.69 percent in one-year survival, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BRL4,610,022 (USD947,414) per death avoided in one year. The annual budget impact ranged from BRL35,660,931 (USD7,328,743) in the first year to BRL457,707,796 (USD94,064,365) in the fifth year, totaling BRL1,230,400,576 (USD252,861,870) over five years. In sensitivity analyses, the lack of a maximum treatment time for the maintenance phase with valganciclovir (50 to 365 days per year) resulted in a wide variation in the ICER and BIA results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being recommended for the treatment of CMV retinitis, the use of valganciclovir in immunocompromised patients with HIV who are seropositive for CMV but have not developed CMV disease has a higher ICER when compared with no prophylaxis. For these patients, appropriate use of standard antiretroviral therapy to improve the immune system may be more appropriate.",bim
10635706,Mountain R,Budget impact analysis of adopting primary care–based case detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Canadian general population,CMAJ Open,2023,"- BACKGROUND: An estimated 70% of Canadians with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have not received a diagnosis, creating a barrier to early intervention, and there is growing interest in the value of primary care-based opportunistic case detection for COPD. We sought to build on a previous cost-effectiveness analysis by evaluating the budget impact of adopting COPD case detection in the Canadian general population. METHODS: We used a validated discrete-event microsimulation model of COPD in the Canadian general population aged 40 years and older to assess the costs of implementing 8 primary care-based case detection strategies over 5 years (2022-2026) from the health care payer perspective. Strategies varied in eligibility criteria (based on age, symptoms or smoking history) and testing technology (COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire [CDQ] or screening spirometry). Costs were determined from Canadian studies and converted to 2021 Canadian dollars. Key parameters were varied in one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: All strategies resulted in higher total costs compared with routine diagnosis. The most cost-effective scenario (the CDQ for all patients) had an associated total budget expansion of $423 million, with administering case detection and subsequent diagnostic spirometry accounting for 86% of costs. This strategy increased the proportion of individuals diagnosed with COPD from 30.4% to 37.8%, and resulted in 4.6 million referrals to diagnostic spirometry. Results were most sensitive to uptake in primary care. INTERPRETATION: Adopting a national COPD case detection program would be an effective method for increasing diagnosis of COPD, dependent on successful uptake. However, it will require prioritisation by budget holders and substantial additional investment to improve access to diagnostic spirometry.",bim
11362395,Espinola N,Budget Impact Analysis of Olaparib for the Management of Patients with Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR)-Mutated Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer in Argentina,Pharmacoecon Open,2024,"- OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform a budget impact analysis (BIA) of introducing olaparib treatment for adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Argentina. METHODS: A BIA model was used to estimate the cost difference between the current scenario (without olaparib) and the new scenario (incorporation of olaparib) for a third-party payer over a 5-year time horizon. The budgetary impact is estimated at the national health system level and by healthcare sectors in Argentina. Input parameters were obtained from the literature and validated by local expert opinion. Direct medical costs were obtained from both the Institute for Clinical Effectiveness and Health Policy (IECS) unit cost database and public data in Argentina. The microcosting estimation was used for key variables of the analysis. All costs are reported in US dollars (US$) as for October 2022 (1 US$ = 152.59 Argentine pesos). One-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate the model robustness. RESULTS: The incorporation of olaparib, with a wholesale price per pack of US$3176, was associated with a weighted average of the budget impact per member per month (PMPM) of US$0.0191 for the national health system, being slightly higher than the estimated budgeted high impact threshold (US$0.0153). The PMPM budget impact for a 5-year average ranged between US$0.007 (public sector) and US$0.033 (private sector). The duration of treatment with olaparib was the most influential parameter in the budget impact results. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of olaparib for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has a high budget impact for Argentina's health system. These findings are informative to support policy decisions aimed to expand the current treatment landscape for prostate cancer.",bim
11430509,Zhang X,Budget impact analysis of high-priced orphan medicinal products intended for the treatment of rare diseases in China: evidence from a densely populated metropolis of Chengdu,BMC Health Serv Res,2024,"- BACKGROUND: An increasing number of orphan medicinal products (OMPs) are being included in social health insurance schemes, significantly improving access to medicines for patients with rare diseases. However, high-priced OMPs are still not covered, primarily due to health equity controversies and inadequate data systems required for economic evaluation. The aim of this study was to estimate the burden of drug expenditures and the size of the reimbursement budget required for high-priced OMPs from the perspectives of society and healthcare payers. METHODS: The study performed a budget impact analysis using data from multiple sources to estimate the reimbursement budget for high-priced OMPs in Chengdu, a densely populated metropolis in China. The budget analysis consisted of three main elements: the number of patients, the price of drugs, and the simulated policy scenario. By adjusting the combinations of these elements, the budget fluctuations for payers were estimated. Furthermore, the study predicted the budget trend for the next three years to validate its sustainability. RESULTS: The analysis indicated that 98 rare disease patients in Chengdu required high-priced OMPs in 2019. This suggested a projected budget of CNY 179 million for these patients without reimbursement policies, from a societal perspective. Under six assumed policy scenarios, this budget ranged from CNY 32 million to CNY 156 million. Over the next three years, the annual budget was estimated to range from CNY 200 million to CNY 1.303 billion. CONCLUSION: Integration of multi-source data helps to obtain more scientifically reliable results on budget impacts. The study found that the budgetary impacts of high-priced OMPs on society and payers are relatively limited. Health policymakers can choose appropriate reimbursement strategies based on financial affordability among a diverse mix of elements. The results of related studies provided insights for optimizing the allocation of health resources and improving patient access to medications.",bim
11522441,Chaplin S,Budget impact analysis of including biosimilar adalimumab on formulary: A United States payer perspective,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2024,"- BACKGROUND: The biosimilar market is growing rapidly, as evidenced by 41 approvals and 37 launches to date. As adalimumab biosimilars launch in the United States, competition among biosimilar and reference adalimumab will likely increase across multiple reference indications, including rheumatology, dermatology, and gastrointestinal diseases, which may lead to decreased payer costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs of adding biosimilar adalimumab to a US commercial plan by exploring various utilization and price differential scenarios. METHODS: A 3-year budget impact model for a US commercial plan of 1 million people was developed to assess switching from reference adalimumab or any self-injectable reference tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor to biosimilar adalimumab. Pharmacy and medical costs were analyzed through high- and low-conversion scenarios from reference adalimumab and the TNF inhibitor class. Price reductions of 5% to 60% relative to reference adalimumab based on previous biosimilar launches were also explored. Short-term medical costs were evaluated as additional simple and complex office visits, with scenarios of half of switch patients having 1 visit up to all switch patients having 10 visits. RESULTS: In a target population of 1,863 patients, switching from reference adalimumab to biosimilar adalimumab had cumulative cost savings of $5,756,073 with slow conversion (10%-20% over 3 years) and $28,780,365 with fast conversion (50%-100% over 3 years). Similar results were seen when switching from any other self-injectable reference TNF inhibitor. Cost savings more than $1 million were seen with a 10% conversion from reference adalimumab and a 15% price reduction from reference adalimumab. Additional office visit scenarios had a negligible impact on budget, with no changes in per-member-per-month costs until all switch patients had 10 additional complex visits, in which per-member-per-month costs increased by $0.02. CONCLUSIONS: In a hypothetical plan of 1 million lives, use of biosimilar adalimumab in commercial plans can lead to significant cost savings for payers because of increased competition. Greater and faster biosimilar conversion rates from reference adalimumab and other reference TNF inhibitors resulted in decreased costs. Additionally, even with short-term medical expenditures, cost savings were still realized when switching to biosimilar adalimumab.",bim
10982321,Fortunato A,A budget impact model and a cost–utility analysis of reducer device (Neovasc) in patients with refractory angina,Front Cardiovasc Med,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Refractory angina (RA) is a chronic condition characterized by the presence of debilitating angina symptoms due to established reversible ischemia in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Treatments for this condition have undergone major developments in recent decades; however, the treatment for RA remains a challenge for medicine. In this sense, the Coronary Sinus Reducer System (CSRS) stands as the last line of therapy for ineligible patients for revascularization with reversible ischemia. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the potential burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and measure the health effects in terms of both quantity (life years) and quality-of-life aspects related to the reducer. METHODS: Two different economic evaluation models were developed as part of the analysis. The budget impact was developed to estimate the potential burden on the NHS from incremental uptake of the use of the reducer in the target population. The utility cost analysis compares and evaluates the quality of life and health resource use and costs between the two alternatives, based on the research of Gallone et al. A deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was carried out to characterize the uncertainty around the parameters of the model. RESULTS: In the budget impact analysis (BIA), the reducer is shown to be more expensive in the first 2 years of the model, due to the gradual uptake in the market and the cost of the device. Starting from the third year, assuming maintenance of effectiveness, there are savings in terms of resource absorption in direct healthcare costs arising from hospitalizations, emergency department accesses, coronarography, and visits avoided. CONCLUSION: The BIA and cost-effectiveness model show that the reducer device, despite an increase in resources absorbed in the first years of implementation and use, has the potential to result in increased quality of life in patients with RA. These costs are largely offset in the short term by the improved clinical outcomes achievable leading to savings from the third year onward in the BIA and a dominance ratio in the cost-utility analysis.",bim
9801587,Mohammadnezhad G,Budget impact analysis of breast cancer medications: a systematic review,J Pharm Policy Pract,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer globally among women, with 2,261,419 new cases in 2020; systemic treatment may be neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, or both. BC subtype guides the standard systemic therapy administered, which consists of endocrine therapy for all HR + tumors, trastuzumab-based HER2-directed antibody therapy plus chemotherapy for all HER2 + tumors (with endocrine therapy given in addition, if concurrent HR positivity), and chemotherapy alone for the triple-negative subtype. This study aimed to identify, evaluate, and systematically review all budget impact analyses (BIAs) of BC medications worldwide. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were thoroughly searched up to 26th March 2022 to identify original published studies which evaluate BIA of BC medications. ISPOR Task Force guidelines were used to assess the quality of included studies. This study was conducted and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 17 BIAs were included in the study. About half of the studies were conducted in Europe. The results of the BIAs showed that most of the included BIAs are conducted from the payer's perspective; they have different methodological frameworks for recommended chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy agents to treat BC. For the same medications, the results of budgetary effects are not consistent in diverse countries. Nine out of the 17 studies were focused on trastuzumab, in which the biosimilar form reduced costs, but the brand form increased costs, especially in a 52-week treatment period. CONCLUSION: Researchers should conduct the budget impact analysis of high-value medications such as anti-tumor drugs more objectively, and the accuracy of parameters needs to be more strictly guaranteed. Furthermore, it is worthy of declaring that the budgetary impact of the same drug is not always consistent over time, so the researchers should measure access to medication in the long run.",bim
11129834,Moiana Uetela DA,Cost‐Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of the Implementation of Differentiated Service Delivery Models for HIV Treatment in Mozambique: a Modelling Study,J Int AIDS Soc,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: In 2018, the Mozambique Ministry of Health launched guidelines for implementing differentiated service delivery models (DSDMs) to optimize HIV service delivery, improve retention in care, and ultimately reduce HIV-associated mortality. The models were fast-track, 3-month antiretrovirals dispensing, community antiretroviral therapy groups, adherence clubs, family approach and three one-stop shop models: adolescent-friendly health services, maternal and child health, and tuberculosis. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis to compare these models to conventional services. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model based on the percentage of enrolment in each model and the probability of the outcome (12-month retention in treatment) for each year of the study period-three for the cost-effectiveness analysis (2019-2021) and three for the budget impact analysis (2022-2024). Costs for these analyses were primarily estimated per client-year from the health system perspective. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Budget impact analysis costs included antiretrovirals, laboratory tests and service provision interactions. Cost-effectiveness analysis additionally included start-up, training and clients' opportunity costs. Effectiveness was estimated using an uncontrolled interrupted time series analysis comparing the outcome before and after the implementation of the differentiated models. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify drivers of uncertainty. RESULTS: After implementation of the DSDMs, there was a mean increase of 14.9 percentage points (95% CI: 12.2, 17.8) in 12-month retention, from 47.6% (95% CI, 44.9-50.2) to 62.5% (95% CI, 60.9-64.1). The mean cost difference comparing DSDMs and conventional care was US$ -6 million (173,391,277 vs. 179,461,668) and -32.5 million (394,705,618 vs. 433,232,289) from the health system and the societal perspective, respectively. Therefore, DSDMs dominated conventional care. Results were most sensitive to conventional care interaction costs in the one-way sensitivity analysis. For a population of 1.5 million, the base-case 3-year financial costs associated with the DSDMs was US$550 million, compared with US$564 million for conventional care. CONCLUSIONS: DSDMs were less expensive and more effective in retaining clients 12 months after antiretroviral therapy initiation and were estimated to save approximately US$14 million for the health system from 2022 to 2024.",bim
11071237,Alsaif M,Budget impact analysis of continuous glucose monitoring in individuals with type 2 diabetes on insulin treatment in England,Health Econ Rev,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: In 2022, updated guidance from NICE expanded the options for self-monitoring of blood glucose for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), to include continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). In this budget impact analysis, the cost impact of CGM was compared with traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with T2DM over 1 year from the commissioner perspective in England. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The NICE-eligible T2DM cohort was split into 4 subgroups to enable nuanced costing by insulin administration frequency: basal human insulin, premixed insulin, basal-bolus insulin and bolus insulin. The model's cost components comprised mild and severe hypoglycaemia (SH), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), consumables and healthcare resource utilisation in primary and secondary care. RESULTS: The introduction of CGM is estimated to be cost additive by approximately £4.6 million in the basecase, driven by increased spending on the CGM device. Overall, healthcare activity was reduced by approximately 20,000 attendances, due to fewer SH and DKA episodes in the CGM arm. General Practitioner (GP) practice-based activity is expected to drop after the first year as patients requiring CGM training is reduced. The budget impact could be neutralised if the CGM sensor was discounted by 13.2% (£29.76 to £25.83). CONCLUSIONS: CGM may result in increased spending in the NICE-eligible T2DM cohort but is expected to reduce demand on secondary care services and GP time. These findings may be of interest to local decision-makers who wish to resolve the COVID-19 backlog with transformational investment in primary care to reduce secondary care activity.",bim
11022086,Win ZM,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of screening and preventive interventions for cardiovascular disease in Myanmar: an economic modelling study,Lancet Reg Health Southeast Asia,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality in Myanmar. Despite the burden, CVD preventive services receive low government and donor budgets, which has led to poor CVD outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effective analysis and a budget impact analysis on CVD prevention strategies recommended by the WHO. A Markov model was used to analyse the cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from healthcare provider and societal perspectives. We calculated transition probabilities from WHO CVD risk data and obtained treatment effects and costs from secondary sources. Subgroup analysis was performed on different sex and age groups. We framed the budget impact analysis from a healthcare provider perspective to assess the affordability of providing CVD preventive care. FINDINGS: The most cost-effective strategy from the healthcare provider perspective varied. The combination of screening, primary prevention, and secondary prevention (Sc-PP-SP) (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: US$1574/QALY) is most cost-effective at the three times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita threshold, while at one time the GDP per capita threshold, secondary prevention is the most cost-effective strategy (ICER: US$160/QALY). Sc-PP-SP is the most cost-effective strategy from the societal perspective (ICER: US$647/QALY). Among age groups, intervention at age 45 years appeared to be the most cost-effective option for both men and women. The budget impact revealed the Sc-PP-SP would avert 55,000 acute CVD events and 28,000 CVD-related deaths with a cost of US$157 million for the first year of CVD preventive care. INTERPRETATION: A combination of screening, primary prevention, and secondary prevention is cost-effective to reduce CVD-related deaths in Myanmar. This study provides evidence for the government and development partners to increase investment in and support for CVD prevention. These findings not only provide a basis for efficient resource allocation but also underscore the importance of adopting a total cardiovascular risk approach to CVD prevention, in alignment with global health goals.

11491932,Smith NR,"Budget impact analysis for implementation decision making, planning, and financing",Transl Behav Med,2023,"- Shelley et al. (in Accelerating integration of tobacco use treatment in the context of lung cancer screening: relevance and application of implementation science to achieving policy and practice. Transl Behav Med 2022;12:1076-1083) laid out how implementation science frameworks and methods can advance the delivery of tobacco use treatment services during lung cancer screening services, which until recently was mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Their discussion provides an important overview of the full process of implementation and highlights the vast number of decisions that must be made when planning for implementation of an evidence-based practice such as tobacco use treatment: what specific tobacco use treatment services to deliver, when to deliver those services within the lung cancer screening process, and what implementation strategies to use. The costs of implementation play a major role in decision making and are a key implementation determinant discussed in major implementation frameworks. When making decisions about what and how to implement, budget impact analyses (BIAs) can play an important role in informing decision making by helping practitioners understand the overall affordability of a given implementation effort. BIAs can also inform the development of financing strategies to support the ongoing sustainment of tobacco use treatment service provision. More attention is needed by the research community to produce high-quality, user-friendly, and flexible BIAs to inform implementation decision making in health system and community settings. The application of BIA can help ensure that the considerable time and effort spent to develop and evaluate evidence-based programs has the best chance to inform implementation practice.",bim
10169960,Cortesi PA,"A Cross-Indication Budget Impact Model of Secukinumab for the Treatment of Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis and Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis in Italy",Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Recent developments improved outcomes in patients with autoimmune diseases. Biologics were approved as first-line treatment in selected naïve patients with plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). Among them, secukinumab was most recently approved for treatment of active nr-axSpA in adults. In this work, we assessed the budget impact of new secukinumab treatment options in the Italian market. METHODS: A cross-indication budget impact model was designed to estimate the effects of adding secukinumab in the Italian market from the National Health System perspective over a 3-year period. The model included all adults with PsO, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA, treated with biologics or biosimilars. It compared costs between two scenarios, secukinumab availability or absence, for the four diseases combined and taken individually. A sensitivity analyses was conducted. RESULTS: There were 68,121 adult patients treated with biologics in 2021 and 68,341 in 2023. The budget impact analysis (BIA) on all indications showed a cost reduction of €33.7 million (- 1.5%) over 3 years with the introduction of secukinumab. PsA patients had the highest saving (- €34.9 million), followed by PsO patients (- €7.8 million). Cost saving in PsO patients was balanced by increased budget reported in AS patients (+ €8.0 million). In nr-axSpA patients, secukinumab reported no significant budget increase (+ 1.0%). CONCLUSION: This BIA accounted for the new indication of secukinumab in nr-axSpA patients, reporting no significant changes in the required budget and adding an effective treatment option. Considering all indications, secukinumab is a sustainable treatment option.",bim
10885175,Eichhober G,A budget impact analysis of a powered hybrid mattress to prevent pressure ulcers in the Austrian inpatient setting: An original research,Health Sci Rep,2024,"- BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pressure ulcer is a considerable health problem and is associated with an increased hospital length of stay (LOS), nursing effort, costs, and reduced quality of life. The aim of this analysis is to compare the economic, clinical, and nursing benefit after the implementation of the powered hybrid mattress Dyna-Form Mercury Advance SMARTcare® in 2019 with the situation in 2017 (rental systems Arjo BariAir® and Arjo TheraKair Visio®, and purchased foam mattresses Arjo Simuflex®) using a single center. METHODS: In the framework of a budget impact analysis, a difference-in-difference approach was used to compare pre-implementation longitudinal data (2017) with post-implementation data (2019). The longitudinal data comprise the mattress resource use, patient characteristics, and LOS. The care effort was gathered based on a full survey of all 75 members of the nursing staff using the online tool ""LimeSurvey."" In this survey, the resource use of the different mattress systems was identified in terms of time (minutes or days). This analysis was performed from the hospital perspective and included direct costs of mattress systems, Austrian diagnostic-related group costs for the hospital stay and nursing staff costs for 2019. RESULTS: Based on 1253 patients ""at-risk,"" the total yearly costs implementing the powered hybrid mattress amounts to 654,248€ compared with 901,469€ when using Arjo products. The budget impact shows a cost advantage of 247,221€. Furthermore, the powered hybrid mattress system leads to fewer nursing-staff time in minutes per year (-1,031,097 min [1,993,204 vs. 3,024,302]); 242€ are saved per patient. Compared with the Arjo products, fewer inpatient cases of pressure ulcers (-44 cases [0 vs. 44]) were documented. CONCLUSION: Despite the higher total outlay of costs associated with the powered hybrid mattress, the long-term savings potential showed a significant cost advantage per annum for the single center. Therefore, the use of the hybrid mattress leads to considerable economic, clinical, and nursing benefits.",bim
11504416,Vivo A,Budget Impact Analysis for the Spread and Financial Sustainability of Videoconference Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs,Antimicrob Steward Healthc Epidemiol,2024,"- Background: In rural areas, antimicrobial stewardship programs often have limited access to infectious disease (ID) expertise. Videoconference Antimicrobial Stewardship Teams (VASTs) pair rural Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers with an ID expert to discuss treatment of patients with concerns for infection. In a pilot study, VASTs were effective at improving antimicrobial use. Here, we evaluated 12-month operating costs for staffing for 3 VASTs. Methods: We used the following data to describe 12 months of clinical encounters for 3 VASTs operating from January 2022 – March 2023: the number of VAST sessions completed and clinical encounters; Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes associated with clinical encounters; session attendees (by role) and the time spent (percent effort) on VAST-related activities. The annual operating cost was based on the annual salaries and percent effort of VAST attendees. We used these characteristics combined with private-sector and Medicare reimbursements to evaluate the cost of implementation and number of clinical encounters needed to offset those costs (breakeven) for each site. Results: Three VASTs recorded 229 clinical encounters during 117 sessions (Table 1). Based on CPT codes, the approximate revenue per patient was $516.46. Site A, the only site to break even, had the most sessions and clinical encounters as well as the lowest operating costs. For Site B, a slight increase in the clinical encounters, which might be achieved by 3 additional VAST sessions, would help achieve breakeven. For Site C, increasing the number of clinical encounters to 3-4 per session would have helped their VAST break even without requiring a decrease in operating costs. Conclusions: The frequency of VAST sessions, volume of clinical encounters, and low operating costs all contributed the VAST at Site A achieving a financial break-even point within 12 months. Consideration of the potential number of clinical encounters and sessions will help other VASTs achieve financial sustainment, independent of cost-savings related to potential decreases in expenditures for antibiotics and antibiotic-related adverse events. These results also provide insight into possible adoption and diffusion of VAST-like programs in the Medicare hospital setting.",bim
11225931,Danielson EC,Implementation Preparation Costs of Virtual Interview Training in Pre-Employment Transition Services: A Budget Impact Analysis,J Spec Educ Technol,2023,"- Virtual Reality Job Interview Training (VR-JIT) and Virtual Interview Training for Transition Age Youth (VIT-TAY) demonstrated initial effectiveness at increasing employment among transition-age youth with disabilities engaged in pre-employment transition services. We characterized activities and estimated the labor and non-labor costs required to prepare schools to implement VR-JIT or VIT-TAY. Implementation preparation and support teams reported labor hours throughout the implementation preparation process. Implementation preparation labor hours at 43 schools cost approximately $1,427 per school, while non-labor costs were $100 per trainee (student). We estimated the replication of implementation preparation labor activities would cost $1,024 per school (range: $841-$1,208). Most costs were spent in delivery planning and teacher training. Given that implementation preparation costs can be barriers to intervention adoption, our results provide critical information for contemplating future implementation of VR-JIT or VIT-TAY.",bim
10306161,Silas U,Fast In-House Next-Generation Sequencing in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Hospital Budget Impact Analysis,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2023,"- Background: Targeted therapy for cancer is becoming more frequent as the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis increases. Molecular testing must be done to use targeted therapy. Unfortunately, the testing turnaround time can delay the initiation of targeted therapy. Objective: To investigate the impact of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine in the hospital that would allow for in-house NGS testing of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in a US setting. Methods: The differences between 2 hospital pathways were established with a cohort-level decision tree that feeds into a Markov model. A pathway that used in-house NGS (75%) and the use of external laboratories (so-called send-out NGS) (25%), was compared with the standard of exclusively send-out NGS. The model was from the perspective of a US hospital over a 5-year time horizon. All cost input data were in or inflated to 2021 USD. Scenario analysis was done on key variables. Results: In a hospital with 500 mNSCLC patients, the implementation of in-house NGS was estimated to increase the testing costs and the revenue of the hospital. The model predicted a $710 060 increase in testing costs, a $1 732 506 increase in revenue, and a $1 022 446 return on investment over 5 years. The payback period was 15 months with in-house NGS. The number of patients on targeted therapy increased by 3.38%, and the average turnaround time decreased by 10 days when in-house NGS was used. Discussion: Reducing testing turnaround time is a benefit of in-house NGS. It could contribute to fewer mNSCLC patients lost to second opinion and an increased number of patients on targeted therapy. The model outcomes predicted that, over a 5-year period, there would be a positive return on investment for a US hospital. The model reflects a proposed scenario. The heterogeneity of hospital inputs and the cost of send-out NGS means context-specific inputs are needed. Conclusion: Using in-house NGS testing could reduce the testing turnaround time and increase the number of patients on targeted therapy. Additional benefits for the hospital are that fewer patients will be lost to second opinion and that in-house NGS could generate additional revenue.",bim
11224988,Pasello G,"Osimertinib in Patients With Treatment-Naive EGFR-Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Overall Survival, Post-progression Management and Budget Impact Analysis in Real-World",Oncologist,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: The observational multicenter prospective FLOWER study (NCT04965701) confirmed effectiveness and safety of osimertinib in the real-world (RW) management of untreated EGFR-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients. METHODS: Herein, we report updated survival data, post-progression management, cost/effectiveness and budget impact (BI) of osimertinib compared with a RW population receiving gefitinib or erlotinib. RESULTS: Overall, 189 Caucasian patients receiving first-line osimertinib were included. After a follow-up of 20.7 months, 74(39.2%) patients discontinued osimertinib, median time-to-treatment discontinuation (mTTD) was 27.9 months, overall survival 36.8 months. At progression, tissue biopsy was performed in 29 (56.9%), liquid biopsy in 15 (29.4%) and both in 7 (13.7%) cases. The most frequent resistant mechanism was MET amplification (N = 14, 29.8%). At data cutoff, 13 (6.9%) patients were continuing osimertinib beyond progression; 52 (67.5%) received second-line treatment; no further treatments were administered in 25 (32.5%) cases. Thirty-three (63.4%) patients received chemotherapy, 12(23.1%) TKIs combination. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a total cost per patient based on RW mTTD of 98,957.34€, 21,726.28€ and 19,637.83€ for osimertinib, erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)/month for osimertinib was 359,806.0€/life-year-gained (LYG) and 197,789.77€/LYG compared to erlotinib and gefitinib. For osimertinib, the BI-gap between RW-TTD and theoretical-TTD was 16,501.0€ per patient. CONCLUSIONS: This updated analysis confirms the effectiveness of osimertinib in RW. Although the ICER of osimertinib seems not cost-effective, additional costs for the management of disease progression to old generation TKIs were not considered in this study. The BI-gap suggests RW mTTD as a more reliable measure for expense estimation.",bim
11798910,Van de Winkel T,Budget Impact Analysis: Digital Workflow Significantly Reduces Costs of Implant Supported Overdentures (IODs),Clin Implant Dent Relat Res,2024,"- BACKGROUND: For edentulism, an implant supported removable complete overdenture (IOD) is an attractive solution to restore patients' chewing capacity, aesthetics, and self‐esteem, however, treatment is expensive and time consuming. PURPOSE/AIM: To estimate the decline in costs for digitally designed and CAD/CAM fabricated IODs (3D‐IODs) compared to conventionally fabricated IODs (C‐IODs) at comparable general health related quality of life (GHRQoL). MATERIALS AND METHOD: A randomized crossover study enrolled 36 fully edentulous patients, in whom six maxillary implants were placed together with two mandibular implants, if not already present. At the start of the study, a set of C‐IODs and 3D‐IODs was fabricated for each patient. All patients wore each IOD‐type for 1 year: first the 3D‐IOD and the second year a C‐IOD, or vice versa. At all three‐time points patients general QoL was assessed using the EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaire as well as the SF‐36 from which the SF‐6D was obtained, to research the anticipation of no significant difference. To enable cost consequence analysis (CCA), both costs made within healthcare and patient costs were assessed. Subsequently, a budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed to demonstrate the potential savings. RESULTS: No differences in general GHRQoL were seen between C‐IOD (M = 0.840, SD = 0.177) and 3D‐IOD (M = 0.837, SD = 0.156) (paired t‐test (N = 31): p = 0.880). With respect to the total costs for a complete IOD, however, the digital approach showed a reduction in initial total costs of 14.2% (€4700.33 vs. €4030.61: p < 0,001), in treatment time of 41.1% (309 vs. 182 min: p < 0.001), and in number of treatment sessions of 47.1% (5.68 vs. 3.0: p < 0.001). For repairs for an IOD in both the upper and lower jaw, the C‐IOD and 3D‐IOD scored similar for treatment time as well as additional costs. CONCLUSION: Implementing a 3D workflow in the production of IOD's supplies patients with a high‐quality 3D‐IOD at lower costs.

10439170,Wong WW,A province-by-province cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis of one-time birth cohort screening of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Canada,Sci Rep,2023,"- Managing chronic hepatitis C is challenging, as the majority of those infected are asymptomatic. Therefore, to ensure treatments are administered before the onset of severe complications, screening is important. In Canada, uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of screening has led to conflicting recommendations. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of one-time HCV screening. A state-transition model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget-impact between a risk-based screening strategy (current-practice) and a one-time screening strategy on three different birth-cohorts. Cost and prevalence data were obtained from administrative data. Progression and utility data were based on recent systematic reviews. We used a provincial payer-perspective, life-time time-horizon and a 1.5% discount rate for the cost-effectiveness analysis, and used a 10-year time-horizon and no discounting for the budget-impact analysis. One-time screening strategy would cost more and provide more health benefits than the risk-based screening for all birth cohorts. For those born after 1964, the incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) of screening versus current-practice varied from $27,422/QALY to $42,191/QALY across different provinces. One-time screening of the cohort would cost an additional $2 million to $236 million across different provinces. For those born 1945-1964, the ICER of screening versus current-practice varied from $35,217/QALY to $48,197/QALY across different provinces. For the cohort born before 1945, the ICER of screening versus current-practice was not cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY across all provinces. Our cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that a one-time HCV screening program for those born after 1945 is cost-effective. Considering the budget impact relative to other funded recommended health services and technologies, HCV screening could be considered affordable.",bim
10259044,Ma Y,Exploration of an alternative reconstructed individual patient data-based approach for budget impact analysis of anticancer drugs,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2023,"- BACKGROUND: The duration of treatment (DOT) of the initial intervention and subsequent treatment is the key to determining the accuracy of anticancer-drug budget impact analysis (BIA) calculations. However, existing studies only use simple assumptions as a proxy for DOT, resulting in a high degree of bias. OBJECTIVES: To enhance the accuracy and reliability of anticancer-drug BIA and solve the problem regarding DOT, we propose an alternative individual patient data (IPD)-based approach that reconstructs IPD from the published Kaplan Meier survival curves to estimate DOT. METHODS: We developed a four-step methodological framework for this new approach, taking the use of pembrolizumab in treating microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) advanced colorectal cancer as an example: (1) reconstructing the IPD; (2) calculating the total DOT of the initial intervention and subsequent treatment for each patient; (3) assigning a randomized time and DOT; and (4) multiple replacement sampling and calculation of the mean value. RESULTS: Using this approach, the average DOT for the initial intervention and subsequent treatment in each year of the BIA time horizon can be calculated and used to calculate the resources consumed and costs in each year. In our example, the average DOT for the initial intervention with pembrolizumab from the first to the fourth year was 4.90, 6.60, 5.24, and 5.06 months, respectively, while the average DOT for subsequent treatment was 0.75, 2.84, 2.99, and 2.50 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed IPD-based approach can improve the accuracy and reliability of anticancer-drug BIA compared with conventional methods, and can be widely used, especially for anticancer drugs with excellent efficacy.",bim
9574700,Mohd Hassan NZ,A symptomatic approach to tuberculosis screening for high-risk groups in Malaysia: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis,J Clin Tuberc Other Mycobact Dis,2022,"- BACKGROUND: One of the crucial areas of eliminating TB is the early detection of cases through the screening programme. This study's focal point is to measure the relative cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the symptomatic approach compared to the existing approach of TB screening (consisted of both symptomatic and asymptomatic screening) among high-risk groups in Malaysia. METHOD: The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) was measured using a decision tree model and the outcome is presented in terms of cost per TB case detected and the ICER. Analysis was conducted using secondary data collected from the Disease Control Division, Sabah and Sarawak State Health Departments. The robustness of the model is determined by Deterministic and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis. Subsequently, Budget impact over 5 years period, from 2018 to 2022 was estimated for both approaches. RESULTS: The symptomatic approach was more cost-effective than the existing approach with ICER of MYR 424.71. The cost of conducting Sputum for Acid Fast Bacilli (SAFB) was found as the key driver for ICER. Budget Impact Analysis showed that switching from the existing approach towards the symptomatic approach would result in a cost-saving of MYR 65.5 million over 5 years. However, this would lead to 4473 TB cases being undetected over the same duration. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the policymakers have to weigh the trade-off between cost-saving and TB case detection. This cost-saving can be channelled to new TB intervention programme with a higher chance of TB case detection. Nevertheless, any decision made must be in concordance to the objectives of the country's TB programme.",bim
10316730,Aiello A,Budget impact analysis for avatrombopag in the treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia in adult patients refractory to other treatments,J Mark Access Health Policy,2023,"- Introduction: Primary immune thrombocytopenia is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by a decreased platelet count resulting in an increased risk of bleeding events and even life-threatening haemorrhages. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are the standard of care second-line therapy for adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia. The first TPO-RAs approved and reimbursed in Italy, eltrombopag and romiplostim, while effective, pose some issues in terms of safety (e.g., hepatotoxicity) or general management (e.g., dietary restrictions). Avatrombopag, an effective and well-tolerated TPO-RA, was recently granted reimbursement. Methods: A 3-year (2023-2025) budget impact analysis (BIA) was conducted to estimate its impact on the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Two scenarios were compared, of which one represents the current situation, without avatrombopag, and the other provides for an increasing market share of avatrombopag (up to 26.6%). Results: BIA shows that the increase in the use of avatrombopag correlates with savings for NHS: in the first year, saving would be €1,300,564, increasing to €2,774,210 in the third year, for a total of €6,083,231 over the 3-year period. The sensitivity analysis confirmed these savings in the scenario with avatrombopag. Conclusions: Based on this BIA, the introduction and reimbursement of avatrombopag is an efficient and advantageous choice for the Italian NHS.",bim
10766175,Palacios A,Budget impact analysis of venetoclax for the management of acute myeloid leukemia from the perspective of the social security and the private sector in Argentina,PLoS One,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the budget impact of the incorporation of venetoclax for the treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) over 75 years of age or those with comorbidities and contraindications for the use of intensive chemotherapy, from the perspective of the social security and the private third-party payers in Argentina. METHODS: A budget impact model was adapted to estimate the cost difference between the current scenario (azacitidine, decitabine and low doses of cytarabine) and the new scenario (incorporation of venetoclax) for a third-party payer over a time horizon of three years. Input parameters were obtained from a literature review, validated or complemented by expert opinion using a modified Panel Delphi approach. All direct medical costs were estimated by the micro-costing approach and were expressed in US dollars (USD) as of September 2020 (1 USD = 76.18 Argentine pesos). RESULTS: For a third-party payer with a cohort of 1,000,000 individuals covered, incorporating venetoclax was associated with an average budget impact per-member per-month (PMPM) of $0.11 USD for the social security sector and $0.07 USD for the private sector. The duration of treatment with venetoclax was the most influential parameter in the budget impact results. CONCLUSION: The introduction of venetoclax was associated with a positive and slight budget impact. These findings are informative to support policy decisions aimed to expand the current treatment landscape of AML.",bim
11668246,Tatar M,Budget Impact Analysis of Implementing Patient Blood Management in the Cardiovascular Surgery Department of a Turkish Private Hospital,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2024,"- PURPOSE: In cardiovascular surgeries, iron deficiency anemia and transfusion of blood products are associated with mortality and morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and poor patient outcomes. Patient blood management (PBM) is a patient-centered approach based on a 'three pillar' model that promotes optimum use of blood and blood products to improve outcomes. This study assessed the potential budget impact of implementing PBM in patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery in a private hospital in Turkey. METHODS: Two models were developed to estimate the hospital budget impact of PBM. The first model encompassed implementation of the first pillar of PBM, which proposes treatment of iron deficiency anemia before a surgical procedure. The second covered implementation of all three pillars of PBM. Budget impact was estimated from the number of avoided complications after treating iron deficiency anemia and reducing blood transfusions. Rates of complication (sepsis, myocardial infarction, renal failure and stroke) with and without PBM were taken from published meta-analyses. Data on 882 cardiovascular operations performed during 2020-2022 were taken from the Florence Nightingale Istanbul Hospital. The costs of treating complications were estimated by applying Turkish Social Security Institution prices to a healthcare resource utilization tool for each complication completed by experts. RESULTS: Results from the budget impact analysis showed that, by implementing the first pillar of PBM, the department could have avoided 30 complications and saved 4,189,802 TRY. For the second model based on implementing all three pillars of PBM, 29 complications could have been avoided by reducing the number of transfusions, with budget savings of 6,174,434 TRY. Reducing the length of hospital stay could have enabled 137 additional operations in the given period. CONCLUSION: Implementation of PBM in patients undergoing elective cardiovascular surgery in private hospitals could be a budget-saving strategy in Turkey and may provide an opportunity to increase revenue.",bim
10427519,de Pouvourville G,Budget Impact Analysis of Expanding Gliflozin Coverage in the CKD Population: A French Perspective,Adv Ther,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: Gliflozins have historically been indicated for type 2 diabetes in France. However, their efficacy has recently been demonstrated in heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD), with positive recommendations by Haute Autorité de Santé for gliflozin therapies in these indications. The study objective was to investigate the 5-year budget impact associated with the introduction of gliflozins in addition to standard therapy in people with CKD and elevated albuminuria, regardless of diabetes status, from the perspective of the French healthcare system. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to estimate the 5-year implications of incorporating gliflozins in the treatment of patients with CKD in France, using efficacy data from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Direct medical costs associated with drug acquisition and management, treatment-related adverse events, dialysis and kidney transplantation, and adverse clinical outcomes were considered. Market share forecasts were estimated from historical data and expert opinions. Event rates were derived from trial data, while cost data were sourced from published estimates. RESULTS: The introduction of gliflozins was estimated to be cost saving compared to the no gliflozins scenario, with an expected cumulative 5-year budget impact of -€650 million, driven by slowed disease progression in patients treated with gliflozins, with fewer patients cumulatively progressing to end-stage kidney disease (84,526 vs. 92,062). This, in addition to fewer hospitalisations for heart failure and deaths from any cause, led to substantial medical care cost offsets (kidney-related: - €894 million; hospitalisation for heart failure: - €14.3 million; end-of-life care: - €17.3 million) to the additional drug acquisition (€273 million) and treatment-related adverse events costs (€2.98 million). CONCLUSION: In concert with early diagnosis and proactive management of CKD, the expansion of the gliflozin indications into the French CKD population presents the opportunity to reduce the substantial burden associated with cardio-renal complications which outweighs the additional cost of the new treatment.

11556681,Alkhatib NS,Budget impact analysis of subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) for treating inflammatory bowel disease in Saudi Arabia: Analysis from payer perspective,PLoS One,2024,"- BACKGROUND: The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) has approved the subcutaneous (SC) administration of infliximab, presenting a more convenient alternative with reduced outpatient visits and diminished expenses compared to the intravenous (IV) administration. However, the financial implications of this formulation have not been examined from the perspective of Saudi payers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prevalence-based budget impact model was developed to evaluate the financial effects of introducing ""environment without"" versus ""with infliximab SC."" The model's time horizon spanned over 2 years (2021-2023), aligning with the biennial national pharmaceutical procurement cycle. The comparison focused on infliximab SC versus all available formulations of infliximab IV in the Saudi market for two inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Treatment comparators' comparability and dose escalations were substantiated by published studies, utilizing dosing information from the summary of product characteristics. Drug acquisition costs were derived from SFDA registered prices, with IV formulation administration costs included. Scenario analysis assessed the budget impact of infliximab SC introduction at uptake rates ranging from 0% to 100%. RESULTS: Introducing infliximab SC demonstrated cost-saving potential in the treatment of IBD. At 100% uptake with UC patients for 2 years, infliximab SC resulted in savings of -SAR-31.9 million (-SAR29,145 per patient). Similarly, for CD, introducing infliximab SC at 100% uptake over 2 years yielded savings of -SAR106.2 million (-SAR36,585 per patient). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that infliximab SC is associated with cost-saving potential when compared to infliximab IV formulations available in Saudi Arabia. Future research should address uncertainties related to real-world comparative effectiveness, the convenience of administration, patient tolerability, and physician acceptance of the SC formulation of infliximab, alongside comparisons with other TNF-alpha inhibitors.",bim
9930828,Aiello A,Budget impact analysis of anakinra in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever in Italy,J Mark Access Health Policy,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease that significantly reduces occupational productivity and quality-of-life in affected patients. Italy has an estimated FMF prevalence of 1 in 60,000 people. While colchicine is the primary treatment for FMF, biologics are administered to intolerant and non-responder patients. Anakinra and canakinumab are the only biologics approved and reimbursed for FMF in Italy. Both medicines have demonstrated efficacy in FMF patients yet differ in treatment costs. This study aimed to perform a budget impact analysis (BIA) following anakinra's reimbursement for FMF treatment, considering pharmaceutical costs from the Italian National Healthcare Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A 'Reference scenario' (all patients treated with canakinumab) was compared to an 'Alternative scenario', with increased anakinra market shares. The target population was estimated based on the Italian population, epidemiological and market research data. Drugs costs were estimated based on Summary of Product Characteristics and net ex-factory prices. Sensitivity analyses were implemented to test results' robustness. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed an overall cumulative expenditure of €30,586,628 for 'Reference scenario' and € 16,465,548 for 'Alternative scenario'. A cumulative savings of €14,121,080 (46.2%) was calculated over 3 years as a result of the reimbursement and increasing uptake of anakinra. The sensitivity analyses, even considering a discount of 50% for canakinumab, confirmed the base case results. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra's introduction, in FMF treatment, provides a financially sustainable option for Italian patients, with savings increasing according to greater use of anakinra.",bim
11719227,Chang HR,PP43 Budget Impact Analysis Of Next-Generation Sequencing Coverage In Taiwan’s National Health Insurance,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: The exploration of molecular characteristics has emerged as a prominent trend to advance precision medicine. The utilization of genetic testing to guide therapy is integral to precision medicine. This study aims to investigate the potential patient populations for the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and assess the budget impact from the perspective of Taiwan’s single insurer, the National Health Insurance Administration. METHODS: To comprehend the scope for medicines with companion diagnostics (CDx) involved, we analyze the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved/cleared diagnostic tests, conduct a literature review to identify medicines approved by the European Medicines Agency that require a CDx, and identify the medicines with CDx involved covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Taiwan. Subsequently, we explore the potential reimbursement indications for NGS testing and conduct a budget impact analysis to evaluate the expected financial impact for the NHI over a five-year period. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted to deal with uncertainty. RESULTS: We have compiled 13 cancer types for which NGS can serve as a companion diagnostic. These encompass non-small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, biliary tract cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and thyroid cancer/medullary thyroid cancer. The implementation of NGS reimbursement in NHI will benefit 25,000 to 30,000 patients undergoing targeted therapies. The projected incremental budget impact ranges from TWD570 million to TWD650 million (USD19 million to USD22 million) over five years. CONCLUSIONS: This study focuses on evaluating the financial impact of incorporating NGS testing into NHI reimbursement for relevant cancer drug indications. The findings can serve as references for the planning of reimbursement policies. However, with the advancement of precision medicine, it is foreseeable that there will be a broader range of applications for NGS, and its cost will gradually decrease.",bim
10439680,Elsisi G,Projecting the Potential Budget Impact Analysis of Paliperidone Palmitate in Egyptian Adult Patients with Schizophrenia,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2023,"- Background: Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that has greater negative consequences on role functioning than many other severe chronic diseases. Objective: We evaluated the economic impact of long-acting injections of paliperidone palmitate (PP) vs daily oral antipsychotics to treat chronic schizophrenia from a societal perspective over a 2-year period. Methods: A static budget impact model was developed to compare PP with daily oral antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole) in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our study included treatments used during relapse and hospitalization, validated by an expert panel. The clinical parameters were extracted from the PRIDE trial. Direct medical costs and indirect costs were measured. The unit cost of drug acquisition for all medications was extracted from the public sector. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The target population in our model was estimated to be 142 incident patients. In the first year, the total drug costs in Egyptian pounds (EGP) for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5.6 million, respectively. In the second year, the total drug costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £2.7 million and £724 004, respectively, while the total medical costs for PP and oral antipsychotics were £3 million and £5 million, respectively. The total costs for PP (£11.6 million) over 2 years were less than those of oral antipsychotics without PP (£12.7 million). PP produced an estimated budget savings of £1 046 561 (budget savings per patient per year, £3667). In addition, PP resulted in the avoidance of 18 hospitalizations per year compared with the without-PP arm. Sensitivity analyses showed that the percent of hospitalizations for both oral antipsychotics and PP had the greatest impact on the results. Conclusion: The lower hospitalization rates associated with PP offset the increase in drug costs. PP may potentially be cost-saving compared with the standard of care in chronic schizophrenia in Egyptian representative healthcare settings. Policy makers may consider this approach to improve patient outcomes and budget sustainability.",bim
10362513,Caruso C,Effects of house dust mite subcutaneous immunotherapy in real-life. Immunological and clinical biomarkers and economic impact analysis,World Allergy Organ J,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Etiology of allergic rhinitis and asthma is frequently associated with house dust mite sensitization and allergen immunotherapy (AIT) represents the only disease modifying treatment. In a real world setting, clinicians would benefit from biomarkers to monitor or predict response to AIT. METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive house dust mite (HDM) mono-sensitized rhinitic patients, treated with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) as per clinical practice, were enrolled. Multiple in vitro biomarkers such as basophil activation (BAT), IL-10 levels, and molecular allergen-specific IgE were performed during HDM SCIT, to monitor the effects of AIT and then correlated to in vivo scores (VAS, CMSS, RQLQ). Nasal cytology was performed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Finally, the economic impact of SCIT in this cohort of patients was evaluated. RESULTS: Clinical biomarkers confirmed to be useful to monitor AIT efficacy. As for laboratory biomarkers, BAT showed a reduction trend, particularly for D2C1, suggesting that this is a useful parameter in monitoring patients. IL-10 levels tend to remain stable or slightly decrease during treatment. The economic analysis confirmed the favorable impact of immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, SCIT confirmed its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and drug utilization. Clinical scores confirmed to be valid in monitoring patients and their response. BAT demonstrated to be useful in monitoring more than predicting response. Further studies are needed to better explore the usefulness of these biomarkers in AIT.",bim
9486155,Duarte RV,Screening trials of spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain in England—A budget impact analysis,Front Pain Res (Lausanne),2022,"- Screening trials of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) prior to full implantation of a device are recommended by expert guidelines and international regulators. The current study sought to estimate the budget impact of a screening trial of SCS and the costs or savings of discontinuing the use of a screening trial. A budget impact analysis was performed considering a study population that reflects the size and characteristics of a patient population with neuropathic pain in England eligible for SCS. The perspective adopted was that of the NHS with a 5-year time horizon. The base case analysis indicate that a no screening trial strategy would result in cost-savings to the NHS England of £400,000-£500,000 per year. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate different scenarios. If ≥5% of the eligible neuropathic pain population received a SCS device, cost-savings would be >£2.5 million/year. In contrast, at the lowest assumed cost of a screening trial (£1,950/patient), a screening trial prior to SCS implantation would be cost-saving. The proportion of patients having an unsuccessful screening trial would have to be ≥14.4% for current practice of a screening trial to be cost-saving. The findings from this budget impact analysis support the results of a recent UK multicenter randomized controlled trial (TRIAL-STIM) of a policy for the discontinuation of compulsory SCS screening trials, namely that such a policy would result in considerable cost-savings to healthcare systems.",bim
10566195,Tajik A,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of lisdexamfetamine versus methylphenidate for patients under 18 with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in Iran,Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) and Methylphenidate (MPH) are stimulant agents that have been shown to provide significant benefits in the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients. AIM: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of LDX compared to MPH as the first-line treatment for ADHD. METHODS: A one-year cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted to compare the effects of LDX and MPH in reducing disease symptoms and patient costs and improving quality of life (QoL) from a social perspective. Clinical data were obtained using the EQ-5D questionnaire. In contrast, economic data were sourced from the official website of the Iranian Food and Drug Association (FDA), the national book of tariffs, and specific questionnaires designed to evaluate patients' direct and indirect costs. 197 patients were included in the study, including individuals who sought psychiatric evaluation at a hospital in Mashhad and those who obtained ADHD medications from governmental pharmacies. The cost-effectiveness of the study medicine was assessed using the decision tree method, and the results were presented as the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis (DSA) and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Additionally, a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) was conducted over five years, considering three different scenarios, to evaluate the financial implications of incorporating LDX into the national pharmaceutical system. RESULTS: The ICER for LDX therapy compared to MPH was estimated at USD 264.28 (with an incremental cost of USD 54.9, incremental effectiveness of 0.208, and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained of 0.765). The PSA indicated a 0.994% probability of LDX being cost-effective, considering a threshold of USD 2450 per QALY. Furthermore, the DSA revealed that the acquisition cost of LDX influenced the model's sensitivity. The BIA demonstrated that incorporating LDX into Iran's healthcare system would result in a financial burden of approximately $368,566 in the first year, representing an additional cost of $11,154 compared to the non-availability of this medicine and the use of previous medications. It is projected that by 2027, the financial burden of treating ADHD with LDX will reach approximately USD 443,879 over five years, amounting to an increase of $71,154 compared to the absence of this medicine. CONCLUSION: From a social perspective, the inclusion of LDX in the treatment regimen for ADHD is associated with higher costs and an increased financial burden. However, based on our analysis, LDX appears to be a cost-effective choice for managing ADHD in Iran when compared to MPH.",bim
10402749,Ken-Opurum J,A value-based budget impact model for dronedarone compared with other rhythm control strategies,J Comp Eff Res,2023,"- Aim: The budgetary consequences of increasing dronedarone utilization for treatment of atrial fibrillation were evaluated from a US payer perspective. Materials & methods: A budget impact model over a 5-year time horizon was developed, including drug-related costs and risks for long-term clinical outcomes (LTCOs). Treatments included antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs; dronedarone, amiodarone, sotalol, propafenone, dofetilide, flecainide), rate control medications, and ablation. Direct comparisons and temporal and non-temporal combination scenarios investigating treatment order were analyzed as costs per patient per month (PPPM). Results: By projected year 5, costs PPPM for dronedarone versus other AADs decreased by $37.69 due to fewer LTCOs, treatment with dronedarone versus ablation or rate control medications + ablation resulted in cost savings ($359.94 and $370.54, respectively), and AADs placed before ablation decreased PPPM costs by $242 compared with ablation before AADs. Conclusion Increased dronedarone utilization demonstrated incremental cost reductions over time.",bim
11653659,Alshahrani A,Budget impact analysis of baricitinib for treatment of alopecia areata: A Saudi hospital perspective,Saudi Pharm J,2024,"- OBJECTIVES: To perform a budget impact analysis (BIA) of the adoption of baricitinib for the management of alopecia areata (AA) by a Saudi public sector payer. METHODS: A BIA model was developed to calculate the expected financial impact under two scenarios: the baseline scenario, which reflects the current mix of treatments without baricitinib, and the projected scenario, in which baricitinib is adopted. The model assumed that patients with severe AA and those with mild-to-moderate AA who did not respond to other treatments were eligible for baricitinib treatment. The model input was based on published evidence, expert opinions, and the Saudi Expert Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Management of AA. RESULTS: Assuming a hypothetical total eligible population of 368 patients received different AA treatments over the 12-months study period. The aggregated 5-years cost in the baseline scenario was SR 5,836,616. Upon the introduction of baricitinib as an alternative treatment for severe AA, the projected aggregated budget impact was SR 7,473,138. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were most sensitive to AA prevalence, percentage of severe AA, and predicted market share for baricitinib over the 5-year time horizon. CONCLUSION: The addition of baricitinib to formularies is likely to increase the cost impact from a government hospital perspective. However, this addition expands the treatment options for patients with AA and may result in improved outcomes. Future cost-effectiveness analyses are recommended to estimate the cost per incremental improvement in the outcomes.",bim
10802124,Bassani R,Budget Impact Analysis of Minimally Invasive versus Open Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion for Lumbar Degenerative Disease: A European Hospital Perspective,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2024,"- PURPOSE: When traditional therapies fail to provide relief from debilitating lower back pain, surgeries such as transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) may be required. This budget impact analysis (BIA) compared minimally-invasive (MI)-TLIF versus open (O)-TLIF for single-level fusion from an Italian hospital perspective. METHODS: The BIA compared costs of 100 MI-TLIF and 100 O-TLIF procedures from an Italian hospital perspective over a one-year time horizon. The base case included costs for length of hospital stay (LOS), blood loss, and sterilizing surgical trays. The scenario analysis also included operating room (OR) time and complication costs. Base case inputs were from the Miller et al meta-analysis; scenario analysis inputs were from the Hammad et al meta-analysis. The device costs for MI-TLIF and O-TLIF procedures were from Italian tender prices for Viper Prime™ System and Expedium™ Spine System, respectively. RESULTS: Base case deterministic analysis results showed cost savings of €207,370 for MI-TLIF compared with O-TLIF. MI-TLIF costs were lower for LOS (€215,277), transfusion for blood loss (€16,881), and surgical tray sterilization (€28,232), whereas device costs were lower for O-TLIF (€53,020). The probabilistic result was similar, with MI-TLIF resulting in savings of €211,026 (95% credible interval [CR]: €208,725 - €213,327). All 1000 base case probabilistic sensitivity analysis runs were cost saving. Deterministic scenario analysis results showed cost savings of €166,719 for MI-TLIF. MI-TLIF costs were lower for LOS (€190,813), transfusion for blood loss (€16,881), surgical tray sterilization (€28,232), and complications (€2076), whereas O-TLIF costs were lower for OR time (€18,263) and devices used (€53,020). CONCLUSION: Despite the increase incremental cost for medical device innovation and OR time, this study demonstrates the economic savings of MI-TLIF compared to O-TLIF from a European hospital perspective. The findings will be useful to policy and hospital decision makers in assessing purchasing, funding and reimbursement decisions.",bim
9746097,Matsela LM,Cost utility and budget impact analysis of dexamethasone compared with bortezomib and lenalidomide for the treatment of second line multiple myeloma from a South African public health perspective,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is an incurable haematological malignancy that is associated with a high probability of relapse. The survival of relapsed patients has been greatly improved by the development of novel drugs such as lenalidomide and bortezomib. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of these drugs as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients in the South African public health care system. METHODS: We modelled 3 treatment strategies for second-line RRMM treatment: dexamethasone (standard of care), bortezomib (BORT) and lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (LEN/DEX) from the South African public health perspective. For each strategy we modelled a hypothetical cohort of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients using a three-state Markov model over a 15-year time horizon. Efficacy and utilization data were obtained from the MM009/010 and APEX trials and external studies. Price and cost data were from local sources and presented in 2021 South African Rands. Outcomes were reported in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for BORT and LEN/DEX and compared to a local cost-effectiveness threshold of R38 500 per DALY averted using the assumption that 1 DALY averted is equal to 1 QALY gained. A budget impact analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial impact of the introduction of BORT and LEN/DEX, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The modelled total costs of DEX, BORT and LEN/DEX were estimated to be R8 312, R234 996 and R1 135 323, respectively. DEX treatment provided 1.14 QALYs while BORT and LEN/DEX treatments provided 1.49 and 2.22 QALYs, respectively. The ICER of BORT versus DEX was R654 649 and that of LEN/DEX versus BORT was R1 225 542. Both BORT and LEN/DEX treatments were not cost-effective relative to a cost-effectiveness threshold of R38 500 per DALY averted. Both BORT and LEN/DEX significantly increase the 1 year budget-cost of RRMM treatment. CONCLUSION: Both BORT and LEN/DEX treatments are unlikely to be cost-effective strategies for second-line treatment of RRMM in South Africa. The results indicate that the drug prices of lenalidomide and bortezomib are key drivers of value for money. Price reductions could potentially make BORT more cost-effective.",bim
11271297,Gunasekara AD,Cost-utility and budget impact analysis of neoadjuvant dual HER2 targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer in Sri Lanka,Sci Rep,2024,"- This study aimed to assess the cost-utility and budget impact of dual to single HER2 targeted neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer in Sri Lanka. A five-health state Markov model with lifetime horizon was used to assess the cost-utility of neoadjuvant trastuzumab (T) plus pertuzumab (P) or lapatinib (L) compared to single therapy of T with chemotherapy (C), in public healthcare system and societal perspectives. Input parameters were estimated using local data, network meta-analysis, published reports and literature. Costs were adjusted to year 2021 (1USD = LKR194.78). Five-year budget impact for public healthcare system was assessed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in societal perspective for neoadjuvantLTC plus adjuvantT (strategy 3), neoadjuvantPTC plus adjuvantT (strategy 2), neoadjuvantLTC plus adjuvantLT (strategy 5), and neoadjuvantPTC plus adjuvantPT (strategy 4) compared to neoadjuvantTC plus adjuvantT (strategy 1) were USD2716, USD5600, USD6878, and USD12127 per QALY gained, respectively. One GDP per-capita (USD3815) was considered as the cost-effectiveness threshold for the analysis. Even though only the ICER for strategy 3 was cost-effective, uncertainty of efficacy parameter was revealed. For strategy 2 neoadjuvant PTC plus adjuvant T, a 25% reduction of neoadjuvant regimen cost was required to be cost effective for use in early HER2 positive breast cancer.",bim
11718712,Santos M,PD02 Budget Impact Analysis: A Challenge To Incorporating Medications For Ultrarare Diseases In The Brazilian Healthcare System,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: The decision-making process for incorporating technologies for ultrarare diseases (URD) has been a challenge for health technology assessment agencies worldwide. These challenges have been presented in debates about the budget impact of incorporating technologies for URD. This is an important issue because there are other dimensions of the economic and social impact of URD that require consideration. METHODS: Data were extracted from National Committee for Health Technology Incorporation (CONITEC) reports (2012 to 2022) on technologies for the treatment of URD in Brazil. Diseases were classified using an epidemiological criterion or Orphanet consultation (prevalence ≤1 per 50,000 inhabitants). Variables included eligible patient count, population estimation method, incremental impact values for one and five years, and diffusion rate in the first and fifth year. Univariate logistic regression was used to adjust the relationship between the budget impact analysis and the final recommendation, considering factors associated with incorporation in univariate regression and p-values less than 0.10 in a multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among 53 reports, 48 percent exclusively employed the epidemiological approach for incremental impact assessment population estimation, rising to 69.5 percent when combined with measured demand. Population data were nearly evenly sourced from national and international platforms, with the UK, the USA, and multicenter studies being the most cited internationally. Notable differences were found between favorable and unfavorable CONITEC recommendations, with lower values being associated with incorporation. Market share diffusion rates favored the option of 100 percent diffusion in both the first year and the cumulative five years. The analysis highlighted the influence of demand characteristics and technology type on the budget impact value over one and five years. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that budget impact data significantly influenced the final recommendation for technology incorporation, indicating a criterion favoring technologies with a lower budget impact. However, requester characteristics and technology type also played a role in the decision-making process, suggesting that additional factors influence recommendations.",bim
9636776,Yoo HK,Budget impact analysis of the subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) for treating inflammatory bowel disease in the Big-5 European (E5) countries,BMC Health Serv Res,2022,"- BACKGROUND: In 2020, the European Medicines Agency approved infliximab subcutaneous (SC) for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. This new mode of infliximab administration will reduce outpatient visits and costs of intravenous (IV) administration. This article describes a budget impact analysis of introducing infliximab SC to the Big-5 European (E5) market (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and UK) for 5 years, from the healthcare payer's perspective. METHODS: A prevalence-based budget impact model was developed to examine the financial impact of infliximab SC. ""World with"" versus ""world without"" infliximab SC scenarios were compared, including the potential administration costs of IV administration. RESULTS: Introducing infliximab SC in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) for 5 years resulted in cost savings of €42.0 million in the UK, €59.4 million in Germany, and €46.4 million in France and Italy, but increased budget expenditure in Spain by €3.8 million. For ulcerative colitis (UC), cost savings of €42.7 million in the UK, €44.9 million in Germany, €44.3 million in France, and €53.0 million in Italy occurred, but with no savings in Spain for 5 years. Cost-savings per patient was calculated by diving the net budget saving by number of treatment eligible patients. Maximum and minimum saving per patient per year ranged between €38.25 and €575.74 in CD, both from Germany, and €105.06 (France) and €647.25 (Germany) in UC. CONCLUSION: Healthcare payers in the UK, Germany, France, and Italy, but not in Spain, will make budget savings by using infliximab SC for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",bim
11574529,van Well EB,The value of reducing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in the treatment of degenerative meniscus tears: a budget impact analysis,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2023,"- AIMS: Numerous studies have shown that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is not (cost-) effective in patients with symptoms attributed to a degenerative meniscus tear. We aimed to assess the budget impact of reducing APM in routine clinical practice in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to simulate patients recently diagnosed with a degenerative meniscus tear. Three strategies were compared: ""current guideline"" (i.e., postpone surgery to at least 3 months after diagnosis), ""APM at any time"" (i.e., APM available directly after diagnosis), and ""nonsurgical"" (i.e., APM no longer performed). Total societal costs over 5 years were calculated to determine the budget impact. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address uncertainty. RESULTS: The average cost per patient over 5 years were EUR 5,077, EUR 4,577, and EUR 4,218, for the ""APM at any time,"" ""current guideline,"" and ""nonsurgical"" strategy, respectively. Removing APM from the treatment mix (i.e., 30,000 patients per year) in the Netherlands, resulted in a reduction in health care expenditures of EUR 54 million (95 percent confidence interval [CI] EUR 38 million-EUR 70 million) compared to the ""current guideline strategy"" and EUR 129 million (95 percent CI EUR 102 million-EUR 156 million) compared to the ""APM at any time"" strategy. Sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty did not alter our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial costs can be saved when APM is no longer performed to treat symptoms attributed to degenerative meniscus tears in the Netherlands. It is therefore recommended to further reduce the use of APM to treat degenerative meniscus tears.",bim
9985892,Punch D,Comprehensive Custom-Pak® in Cataract and Vitreoretinal Surgery in Canadian Hospitals: Time and Budget Impact Analysis,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2023,"- PURPOSE: Surgical procedure packs are commonly used in ophthalmological surgeries, but quantitative evidence demonstrating the time efficiency and economic impact of their use is limited. Evaluating the time and cost of surgical pack use is particularly important for publicly funded healthcare systems with tight budgets and/or an emphasis on value-based care. This study sought to estimate the economic impact of comprehensive surgical pack use in cataract and vitreoretinal (retina) surgeries across operating room (OR), materials management, and accounting departments in Canada. METHODS: A budget impact model developed for the United States (US) from a self-reported cross-sectional study was adapted for Canada. The US study obtained data via an online survey and timing exercises of surgical procedures. The model was adapted using relevant Canadian-specific labor and cost inputs. Use of generic commodity packs (no proprietary equipment-specific supplies) was compared to full utilization of Custom-Pak(®), a comprehensive pack (disposables plus equipment-specific supplies) in cataract and retina surgeries at the facility and aggregate group (provincewide) levels. RESULTS: Switching from generic to comprehensive pack use in all 2500 cataract procedures at a community hospital saves 287 labor hours per year, primarily in the materials management department. Surgery preparation (OR) hours saved allow for an additional 196 potential procedures annually. Most of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) $39,815 annual cost savings are realized for the OR. Aggregating across 50,000 cataract surgeries at the provincial level yields savings of 5608 hours and 3916 additional procedures, translating to hidden cost reductions of CAD$790,632 annually. Implementing full Custom-Pak use at the facility level in 1000 retina cases saves $10,650 annually; provincewide, 127 potential additional procedures can be gained. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive Custom-Pak use improves efficiency in cataract and retina surgeries saving substantial time and cost in Canadian hospitals, potentially allowing more patients to have these procedures, and reducing wait times.",bim

Clinical studies were utilized to extract data on drug efficacy and patients' utility, while cost data were collected from Greek sources. The results of the study showed that aboBoNT-A plus BSC was a cost-effective treatment option for both upper and lower limb spasticity in adult patients compared to BSC. Additionally, introducing aboBoNT-A into the Greek healthcare system resulted in cost savings in pharmaceutical spending over a 5-year period. The findings suggest that incorporating aboBoNT-A into the Greek healthcare system could improve patient access to treatment and healthcare resource efficiency, as it is a more economical option compared to onaBoNT-A.",bim
10351593,Hamouda M,Budget Impact Analysis of Single-Inhaler Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol in Patients with Asthma in the Dubai Academic Healthcare Corporation,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,2023,"- PURPOSE: Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disorder associated with substantial societal and economic burden globally, despite the availability of different treatment modalities. GSK has developed a once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT), comprised of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI); a combination of inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and long-acting β(2)-agonist for patients with uncontrolled asthma. A budget impact analysis was conducted to determine the financial impact of introducing FF/UMEC/VI SITT from the perspective of the Dubai Academic Healthcare Corporation (DAHC). METHODS: A budget impact model was constructed using an epidemiology-based approach and used to estimate the expected 5-year budget impact of including FF/UMEC/VI for the treatment of eligible patients within the DAHC in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The model included both pharmacy and efficacy-related costs. The perspective of the DAHC healthcare payer was adopted, thus only direct payer costs were included in the analysis. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the model structure, assumptions, and input parameters. RESULTS: The total budget impact was estimated to save 1 million United States Dollars (USD) over 5 years, with budget impacts of 0.08 million USD in Year 1; 0.14 million USD in Year 2; 0.22 million USD in Year 3; 0.28 million USD in Year 4; and 0.33 million USD in Year 5. The overall budget impact per patient was estimated to save 12.2 USD over 5 years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the budget impact was most sensitive to changes in the market uptake of FF/UMEC/VI. CONCLUSION: Healthcare payers may consider FF/UMEC/VI in the management of uncontrolled asthma which would save costs and reduce healthcare resource use in the UAE.",bim
9771058,Jutkowitz E,BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS OF NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA,Innov Aging,2022,"- Non-pharmacologic dementia care interventions significantly reduce the risk of a nursing home admission for people living with dementia. We used an evidence-based mathematical model to evaluate the budget impact for a healthcare payer that independently implemented four non-pharmacologic dementia care interventions that reduce the risk of transitioning to a nursing home for people living with dementia: 1) MIND, an at-home care coordination intervention; 2) NYU Caregiver (NYUCI), provides caregivers with counseling and ad-hoc support; 3) Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care (ADC) program, a clinic based care coordination intervention; and 4) Adult Day Services Plus (ADS-Plus), an adult day based care coordination intervention. Healthcare payer costs included Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. We simulated a cohort of 302,630 community-dwelling people with dementia, which is the number of people who were diagnosed with dementia in 2018. We applied each intervention’s inclusion criteria to determine the proportion of the cohort that would receive the interventions. Some people may die or enter a nursing home before receiving the interventions. MIND, NYUCI, ADC, and ADS-Plus reduced annual payer expenditures (relative to $25,000, which is the average amount Medicare-Medicaid pay per person with dementia) on average by 0.67%, 0.23%, 0.13%, and 0.58%, respectively over 5 years. Cost savings for the interventions varied by demographics. African American females between ages 95-100 who received NYUCI had the largest cost savings ($2,750.57). White females between ages 65-70 who received ADC had an increase in payer costs ($2,397.07). On average, non-pharmacologic dementia care intervention do not increase a healthcare payer’s budget.",bim
10015636,Azzeri A,Budget impact analysis of two treatment approaches for hepatitis C in Malaysia through the use of voluntary and compulsory licensing options,Front Public Health,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: A scaled-up treatment cascade with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy is necessary to achieve global WHO targets for hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination in Malaysia. Recently, limited access to sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DAC) is available through compulsory licensing, with access to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) expected through voluntary licensing due to recent agreements. SOF/VEL has superior clinical outcomes but has higher drug acquisition costs compared to SOF/DAC. A stratified treatment cascade might be the most cost-efficient approach for Malaysia whereby all HCV patients are treated with SOF/DAC except for patients with cirrhosis who are treated with SOF/VEL. METHODS: This study aimed to conduct a 5-year budget impact analysis of the proposed stratified treatment cascade for HCV treatment in Malaysia. A disease progression model that was developed based on model-predicted HCV epidemiology data was used for the analysis, where all HCV patients in scenario A were treated with SOF/DAC for all disease stages while in scenario B, SOF/DAC was used only for non-cirrhotic patients and SOF/VEL was used for the cirrhotic patients. Healthcare costs associated with DAA therapy and disease stage monitoring were included to estimate the downstream cost implications. RESULTS: The stratified treatment cascade with 109 in Scenario B was found to be cost-saving compared to Scenario A. The cumulative savings for the stratified treatment cascade was USD 1.4 million over 5 years. DISCUSSION: A stratified treatment cascade with SOF/VEL was expected to be cost-saving and can result in a budget impact reduction in overall healthcare expenditure in Malaysia.",bim
11748570,Thsehla E,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis in South Africa,BMC Health Serv Res,2025,"- BACKGROUND: More than 800 million people are affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. In South Africa, the prevalence of CKD increased by 67% between 1999 and 2006. Haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and kidney transplant are the three main modalities used for managing end stage kidney disease. The cost of these therapies poses a significant burden to the health care system in South Africa. The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis from the societal perspective in South Africa. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis. The model was developed in excel and populated with clinical evidence and cost data synthesized from the literature. The costs and outcomes were estimated over a 5-year time-horizon. The outcomes were presented as quality-adjusted life years. Cost effectiveness was estimated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also conducted to assess the robustness of the results. A budget impact model was constructed to estimate the impact of PD and HD over a 5 year period. RESULTS: The total discounted costs per patient over 5 years were R788 384 for PD versus R1 227 708 for HD. The incremental cost for providing PD was estimated at -R438 875. The net QALYs for delivering PD compared to HD were estimated at -0.09. Cost effectiveness ratio for PD versus PD was R5 096 154/QALY. At a threshold of R38 500, PD provision has a 79% probability of being cost-effective relative to HD. The INMB was estimated at R328 574 for PD and R322 194 for HD indicating the cost-effectiveness of PD. The budget impact analysis showed that it would cost government approximately R25 billion over 5 years to treat all individuals eligible for KRT under the current scenario of 88% HD and 12% PD. CONCLUSIONS: In South Africa, PD is shown to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of less than R38 500. A PD-preferred policy that considers clinical appropriateness and patients' values should be considered.",bim
10623695,Zemdegs J,Water intake and recurrent urinary tract infections prevention: economic impact analysis in seven countries,BMC Health Serv Res,2023,"- BACKGROUND: To estimate the economic impact of preventing urinary tract infections (UTI) by increasing water intake among women with recurrent UTI and low fluid intake across seven countries: France, United Kingdom, Spain, United States of America, Mexico, China and Australia. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of UTIs associated with low fluid intake in women versus a strategy of primary prevention by increasing water intake. Model inputs were based on randomized controlled trial data which found that increasing water intake by 1.5 L/day decreased the risk of developing cystitis by 48% in women with low fluid intake and recurrent UTI. A time horizon of 10 years was used; outcomes were from the payer perspective and included both direct and indirect costs, reported in 2019 United States dollars ($). Discounting rates varied by country. Scenarios of increasing levels of compliance to the increased water intake strategy were evaluated. RESULTS: The total cost of one UTI episode, including diagnostics, treatment and complications, ranged from $2164 (Mexico) to $7671 (Australia). Assuming 80% compliance with the increased water intake strategy over a 10-year time horizon, the number of UTIs prevented ranged from 435,845 (Australia) to 24150,272 (China), resulting in total savings of 286 million (Australia) to $4.4 billion (China). Across all countries, increased water intake resulted in lower cost and fewer UTIs compared with low water intake. CONCLUSION: Preventing recurrent UTIs by increasing water intake would reduce both the clinical and economic burden associated with UTI. Public, healthcare professionals and patients should be made aware about the preventive positive impact of appropriate water intake on UTIs.",bim
11719226,Xiao D,"PD01 Budget Impact Analysis Of Expanding Newborn Inherited Metabolic Diseases Screening In Shanghai, China",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: China has a high incidence of birth defects. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) screening enables rapid detection of multiple inherited metabolic disorders and has been widely promoted globally. This study aimed to conduct a budget impact analysis of replacing phenylketonuria screening with MS/MS by calculating the financial impact of reimbursing the costs of MS/MS screening. METHODS: An Excel-based budget impact analysis model for MS/MS screening was developed. The number of newborns in Shanghai from 2024 to 2026 was estimated using the birth rate trend among the permanent population of Shanghai over the past decade. By integrating clinical screening data, along with the corresponding screening costs and diagnostic fees for the gold standard test, the financial impact of replacing phenylketonuria screening with MS/MS screening was calculated. The screening data for this study was extracted from a tertiary hospital in Shanghai. Demographic data were obtained from statistical websites, while cost data were derived from literature and a tertiary hospital in Shanghai. RESULTS: The fiscal expenditures for phenylketonuria screening were CNY1.75 million (USD0.25 million), CNY1.65 million (USD0.23 million), and CNY1.56 million (USD0.22 million) for 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding fiscal expenditures for MS/MS were CNY25.23 million (USD3.54 million), CNY23.78 million (USD3.33 million), and CNY22.41 million (USD3.14 million). The additional fiscal expenditure for MS/MS, compared with phenylketonuria screening, was CNY23.48 million (USD3.29 million), CNY22.13 million (USD3.10 million), and CNY20.85 million (USD2.92 million), showing a yearly decreasing trend. CONCLUSIONS: The financial impact of MS/MS screening was controllable. It was recommended that the cost of MS/MS screening in Shanghai be covered by government funding. The promotion of newborn screening using MS/MS deserves priority consideration and publicity in Shanghai, China.",bim
10877896,Goudarzi Z,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of enzalutamide in comparison to abiraterone in treatment of metastatic prostate cancer resistant to castration in Iran,BMC Urol,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: In recent years, enzalutamide and abiraterone have been widely used as treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, the cost-effectiveness of these drugs in Iran is unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer resistant to castration in Iran. METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide and abiraterone from a social perspective over 10 years. The clinical inputs were obtained from the meta-analysis studies. The direct medical costs were obtained from the tariffs of the healthcare system, while the direct non-medical and indirect costs were collected from the patients. The data of utilities were derived from the literature. In addition, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainties. RESULTS: Compared with Abiraterone, enzalutamide was associated with a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6,260 per QALY gained. According to the one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER was most heavily influenced by the prices of enzalutamide and Abiraterone, non-medical costs, and indirect costs. Regardless of the variation, enzalutamide remained cost-effective. The budget impact analysis of enzalutamide in the health system during 5 years was estimated at $6,362,127. CONCLUSIONS: At current prices, adding enzalutamide to pharmaceutical lists represents the cost-effective use of the healthcare resources in Iran for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",bim
10476813,Seyedifar M,Budget impact analysis of temocillin insurance coverage for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens in Iran,Medicine (Baltimore),2023,"- BACKGROUND: One of the most prevalent infections with a significant disease burden is urinary tract infections (UTIs), which occurs in approximately 50% of women at least once in their lifetime. Antimicrobial resistance to pathogens causing UTIs is expanding worldwide and has been associated with increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including carbapenems, leading to significant costs for insurance and healthcare systems. The emergence of resistance to carbapenems has led to an increasing need for and interest in carbapenem-sparing strategies, including the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as temocillin. Temocillin has a strong bactericidal effect, along with high tolerability and a good safety profile. It is also stable toward most extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). The purpose of our study was to design a budget impact analysis (BIA) model and estimate the budget impact of temocillin insurance coverage for the treatment of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing bacteria from the perspective of the payer. METHODS: The BIA model with insurance payer perspective was used to estimate the impact of temocillin insurance coverage on the treatment of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing bacteria over a 1-year time horizon in Iran. Direct medicine costs, hospitalization and paraclinical costs, and side effect costs were considered in this model. To assess the impact of uncertainty on the model inputs, 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that inclusion of temocillin in insurance coverage, decreasing treatment costs from $36 million to $34 million, will result in overall savings of > $1.9 million and lead to > $9 million savings in insurance costs for antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of temocillin in the insurance coverage in Iran for patients developing UTIs caused by ESBL-producing bacteria would be cost-saving for insurance and decrease the risk associated with emerging antimicrobial resistance.",bim
11365817,Morgans AK,Within-trial hospitalization resource utilization and budget impact analysis for darolutamide in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer using ARASENS,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2024,"- BACKGROUND: ARASENS was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial comparing darolutamide + docetaxel + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with placebo + docetaxel + ADT in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To use clinical trial data from ARASENS to understand whether the addition of darolutamide to docetaxel + ADT leads to increased hospitalizations and to estimate the budget impact on the US health care system. METHODS: We used mixed-effects negative binomial regression to estimate hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates and length of hospital stay (LoHS) counts. Hospitalization rates were estimated per treatment arm for the period during and after administration of docetaxel. Based on these estimates, a budget impact analysis evaluated the hospitalization costs (including ICU admissions) and standalone ICU hospitalization costs for the totality of the US population over a 5-year time horizon. The analysis compared a scenario without darolutamide vs one with darolutamide included in the US payer formulary. Hospitalization estimates were varied in a one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The first 4 months of treatment (when patients were receiving docetaxel) were associated with increased hospitalizations across both arms. The addition of darolutamide was associated with a numerical reduction in the rate of hospitalization (per year) due to any reason both during docetaxel treatment (1.01 visits per year [95% CI = 0.82-1.20] vs 1.18 visits per year [95% CI = 0.96-1.41]) and after docetaxel treatment (0.28 visits per year [95% CI = 0.23-0.34] vs 0.33 visits per year [95% CI = 0.27-0.40]). Darolutamide was associated with a marginally longer LoHS per hospitalization compared with placebo (+1.90 days per year) both during and after docetaxel treatment. ICU admissions were low in the ARASENS data; admission rates were assumed to be the same during and after docetaxel treatment. ICU admission rate estimates were equivalent across arms (0.02 visits per year [95% CI = 0.01-0.03]). The budget impact per treated member per month represents a cost-neutral option after Year 5 with a cumulative budget impact of -$9.71. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of darolutamide to docetaxel + ADT was associated with a numerically lower rate of hospitalization but marginally longer LoHS compared with docetaxel + ADT alone. Darolutamide represents a cost-neutral alternative per treated member per month compared with docetaxel + ADT with regard to hospitalizations at the end of a 5-year time horizon.",bim
10423465,Stajszczyk M,Budget impact analysis and treatment availability with biosimilar TNF inhibitors in rheumatic diseases in Poland: real-world evidence using a nationwide database,Ann Rheum Dis,2023,"- OBJECTIVES: Although several years have passed since biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs were introduced to the market, considerable disparities in access still remain. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) have proven to be highly effective and safe for treating patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). The emergence of biosimilars is promising for cost reduction and more equitable, widespread access. METHODS: A retrospective budget impact analysis based on final drug prices was conducted using 12 687 treatment courses for infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab. Estimated and real-life savings for public payer were calculated from an 8-year perspective of TNFi use. Data on the treatment cost and on the evolution in the number of patients treated was provided. RESULTS: From a public payer perspective, the estimated total savings amount to over €243 million for TNFi, with over €166 million attributed to treatment cost reduction in RMDs. Real-life savings were calculated as €133 million and €107 million, respectively. The rheumatology sector generated between 68% and 92% of total savings across models, depending on the adopted scenario. The overall decrease in mean annual cost of treatment ranged between 75% and 89% in the study frame. If all budget savings were spent on reimbursement of additional TNFi, a hypothetical total of almost 45 000 patients with RMDs could be treated in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nation-level analysis that shows estimated and real-life direct cost-savings for TNFi biosimilars. Transparent criteria for reinvesting savings should be developed on both a local and an international levels.",bim
11194975,Tajik A,Cost‐Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis of Apixaban and Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin in the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) in Iran,Clin Cardiol,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Apixaban and Rivaroxaban, compared to Warfarin, for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in Iran. METHOD: A Markov model with a 30-year time horizon was employed to simulate and assess different treatment strategies' cost-effectiveness. The study population comprised Iranian adults with NVAF, identified through specialist consultations, hospital visits, and archival record reviews. Direct medical costs, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs were included. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed using an EQ-5D questionnaire. This study utilized a cost-effectiveness threshold of $11 134 per QALY. RESULTS: Apixaban demonstrated superior cost-effectiveness compared to Rivaroxaban and Warfarin. Over 30 years, total costs were lower in the Apixaban and Rivaroxaban groups compared to the Warfarin group ($126.18 and $109.99 vs. $150.49). However, Apixaban showed higher total QALYs gained compared to others (0.134 vs. 0.133 and 0.116). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for comparing Apixaban to Warfarin was calculated at -1332.83 cost per QALY, below the threshold of $11 134, indicating Apixaban's cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings, with ICER consistently remaining below the threshold. Over 5 years (2024-2028) of Apixaban usage, the incremental cost starts at USD 70 250 296 in the first year and gradually rises to USD 71 770 662 in the fifth year. DSA and PSA were assessed to prove the robustness of the results. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Apixaban is a cost-effective option for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients in Iran compared to Warfarin.",bim
11252110,Rojas-Roque C,Budget Impact Analysis of Olaparib in Combination with Bevacizumab for Maintenance Therapy for Ovarian Cancer in Argentina,Pharmacoecon Open,2024,"- OBJECTIVES: To perform a budget impact analysis (BIA) of introducing olaparib as maintenance therapy in women who have BRCA mutations (BRCAm) with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (PSROC) in combination with bevacizumab in Argentina. METHODS: A BIA model was used to analyse over a 5-year time horizon the change in the health system's budget following the adoption of olaparib as maintenance therapy in BRCAm patients with PSROC. The BIA for each year was estimated by comparing the cost difference between the current scenario (treatment with bevacizumab) and the new scenario (the addition of olaparib) for a third-party payer. The BIA is estimated at the national health system level, and by healthcare sectors in Argentina (public sector, social security and private sector). International and national epidemiological data were used to determine the target patient population. Clinical efficacy, safety outcomes and duration of treatments were obtained from the pivotal clinical study report. Relevant direct medical costs were obtained from public data in Argentina and expert consultation. All the costs are reported in US dollars as of October 2022 ($1 = 152.59 Argentine pesos). A scenario analysis assessed the full coverage of the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test in Argentina. In addition, one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the model robustness. RESULTS: For a third-party payer with a cohort of 1,000,000 women covered, the estimated target population was 2 individuals in year 1 and 6 individuals in year 5. The incorporation of olaparib, with a wholesale price per pack of $3176.32, was associated with a weighted average of the budget impact per member per month (PMPM) of $0.062 for the national health system, being above the estimated health system budget impact threshold ($0.0153). By healthcare sector, the results of budget impact PMPM for year 5 ranged between $0.08 (public sector) and $0.114 (private sector). For all perspectives, the variables that most influenced the budget impact was the incidence of ovarian cancer, the drug acquisition cost and the treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of olaparib for the treatment of BRCAm women with PSROC has a high budget impact for all three health systems in Argentina.",bim
10570167,Pahmeier K,Vaccinating the German Population Aged 60 Years and Over with a Quadrivalent High-Dose Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Compared to Standard-Dose Vaccines: A Transmission and Budget Impact Model,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Germany, influenza vaccination is mainly advised for persons aged 60 years and over and individuals with health risks. Since 2021, an inactivated, quadrivalent high-dose influenza vaccine (IIV4-HD) has been recommended for persons aged 60 years and over. The aim of this study was to calculate the impact of vaccinating the German population aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) with regard to health outcomes and costs. METHODS: An age-stratified deterministic compartment model was built to simulate the course of influenza infection for the German population in the season 2019/20. Probabilities for health outcomes and cost data were searched from the literature and were used to compare the influenza-related health and economic effects for different scenarios. Perspectives were those of the statutory health insurance and the society. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: From the statutory health insurance perspective, vaccinating the German population aged 60 years and over with IIV4-HD would have prevented 277,026 infections (- 1.1%) with an increase of overall direct costs of €224 million (+ 40.1%) compared with IIV4-SD. A separate analysis showed that increased vaccination of 75% (World Health Organization recommendation for older age groups) in persons aged 60 years and over using IIV4-SD only would prevent 1,289,648 infections (- 5.1%) and would save costs from a statutory health insurance perspective of €103 million (- 13.2%) compared with IIV4-HD at actual vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: The modeling approach offers important insights into the epidemiological and budgetary impact of different vaccination scenarios. Achieving a higher vaccination coverage with IIV4-SD in persons aged 60 years and over would result in lower costs and fewer influenza infections compared with the scenario with IIV4-HD and actual vaccination rates.",bim
11058738,Pitsillidou O,Can Cyprus Afford Luspatercept? A Budget Impact Analysis of the Reimbursement of Luspatercept for the Management of Thalassaemia in Cyprus,Pharmacoecon Open,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the budget impact of luspatercept reimbursement as an adjuvant to the standard management of β-thalassaemia major in Cyprus, from a societal perspective, and assess the financial feasibility of its inclusion in the β-thalassaemia armamentarium. METHODS: A 5-year horizon budget impact model was developed to determine the budget impact of reimbursing luspatercept for the management of β-thalassaemia major in Cyprus. Two treatment discontinuation scenarios were elaborated. In the first scenario, luspatercept is reimbursed complementary to best supportive care, and a dropout rate of 40% is assumed based on published real-world data, while for the second scenario a dropout rate of 25%, is assumed as per the clinical trial data. Input parameters were retrieved from the phase III clinical trial of luspatercept, literature, and expert opinion consensus. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for both scenarios. RESULTS: The addition of luspatercept to the standard management of β-thalassaemia major in Cyprus imparted an incremental budget impact ranging from €21,300,643 to €25,834,368, depending on the drop-out rate scenario assumed. Results were sensitive to the number of eligible patients and dose per patient. CONCLUSION: The potential reimbursement of luspatercept will wield a substantial impact on Cyprus total pharmaceutical expenditure and it is therefore imperative to affix a reimbursement framework that will allow the payer to mitigate uncertainty stemming out of the scarce clinical data and the inherently complex therapeutic landscape of β-thalassemia management.",bim
11729056,Chamani AT,Budget Impact Analysis of Implementing Antenatal Care Recommendations for Positive Pregnancy Outcomes at Public Primary Facilities in Tanzania,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Tanzania recently changed its antenatal care (ANC) guidelines to reduce perinatal mortality and improve the experience of pregnancy care. The new guideline recommends increasing the number of ANC visits from four to eight and introducing one routine ultrasound scan, among other recommendations. We estimated the budget impact of implementing the new guideline compared to the previous focused ANC guideline at public dispensaries and health centers. METHOD: In a dynamic Markov model, we prospectively followed annual cohorts of between 2.3 and 2.6 million pregnant women who will be attending ANC at dispensaries and health centers for 5 years. We allowed a population of pregnant women into the model every year and women exit the model at delivery. We calculated the cost of medicines, medical supplies, and laboratory supplies required to produce services from a public health system perspective. Our model neither estimated condition-related costs nor health effects. The budget impact was calculated as the difference in the estimated costs between the two guidelines. We conducted scenario analyses to explore attending more visits and different assumptions to calculate the target population. RESULTS: We estimated that implementing the new ANC guideline would have a cumulative budget impact of around US$154 million over 5 years. The budget required will increase from US$137 million under the focused ANC guideline to US$291 million under the new guideline. Laboratory supplies will consume 47% of the estimated budget under the new guideline. We expect the annual budget impact to be US$38 million in the first year of implementation and US$32 million in the fifth year. We assumed that by the fifth year, 82% of all pregnant women would have had four or more visits. The budget impact would increase to US$214 million, with the proportion of pregnant women attending four or more ANC visits reaching 90% within 5 years. CONCLUSION: Scaling up the implementation of the new ANC guideline at public dispensaries and health centers may substantially increase the supplies required to produce ANC services, particularly laboratory supplies. Studies on the health impact of the new guideline are warranted to estimate the value for money.",bim

11326742,Silva LF,Budget impact analysis of cabergoline for medical treatment of Cushing’s disease in Brazil,Arch Endocrinol Metab,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the budget impact of adding cabergoline to the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) formulary for the treatment of patients with Cushing's disease (CD) who do not achieve disease control after transsphenoidal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a budget impact analysis (BIA) from the perspective of the Brazilian SUS over a 5-year time horizon. We compared two scenarios: ketoconazole (Scenario 1) versus including cabergoline as a treatment option (Scenario 2). All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel. Uncertainty was explored in univariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The total costs were BRL $25,596,729 for Scenario 1 and BRL $32,469,169 for Scenario 2. The budget impact of adding cabergoline to the formulary for CD treatment within the SUS would be BRL $6,091,036 over 5 years. On univariate analyses, variations in the rates of surgical failure and CD recurrence had the greatest potential to affect the final costs associated with cabergoline. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated budget impact of adding cabergoline to the formulary for CD treatment within the Brazilian SUS would be about BRL $6 million. While cost savings cannot be expected, the budget impact of adding cabergoline would be lower than that of adding other treatment options for CD.",bim
10636820,Eisman AB,A mixed methods partner-focused cost and budget impact analysis to deploy implementation strategies for school-based prevention,Implement Sci Commun,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Obtaining information on implementation strategy costs and local budget impacts from multiple perspectives is essential to data-driven decision-making about resource allocation for successful evidence-based intervention delivery. This mixed methods study determines the costs and priorities of deploying Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs (REP) to implement the Michigan Model for Health™, a universal school-based prevention intervention, from key shareholder perspectives. METHODS: Our study included teachers in 8 high schools across 3 Michigan counties as part of a pilot cluster randomized trial. We used activity-based costing, mapping key Enhanced REP activities across implementation phases. We included multiple perspectives, including state agencies, regional education service agencies, lead organization, and implementers. We also conducted a budget impact analysis (BIA, assessing the potential financial impact of adopting Enhanced REP) and a scenario analysis to estimate replication and account for cost variability. We used an experimental embedded mixed methods approach, conducting semi-structured interviews and collecting field notes during the trial to expand and explain the cost data and the implications of costs across relevant perspectives. RESULTS: Based on trial results, we estimate costs for deploying Enhanced REP are $11,903/school, with an estimated range between $8263/school and $15,201/school. We estimate that adding four additional schools, consistent with the pilot, would cost $8659/school. Qualitative results indicated misalignment in school and teacher priorities in some cases. Implementation activities, including training and implementation facilitation with the health coordinator, were sometimes in addition to regular teaching responsibilities. The extent to which this occurred was partly due to leadership priorities (e.g., sticking to the district PD schedule) and organizational priorities (e.g., budget). CONCLUSIONS: Previous research findings indicate that, from a societal perspective, universal prevention is an excellent return on investment. However, notable misalignment in cost burden and priorities exists across shareholder groups. Our results indicate significant personal time costs by teachers when engaging in implementation strategy activities that impose an opportunity cost. Additional strategies are needed to improve the alignment of costs and benefits to enhance the success and sustainability of implementation. We focus on those perspectives informed by the analysis and discuss opportunities to expand a multi-level focus and create greater alignment across perspectives.

11143467,Li Y,Budget Impact Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Colon Cancer in Commercial Health and Medicare Advantage Plans,JAMA Health Forum,2024,"- IMPORTANCE: In a randomized clinical trial, treatment guided by tumor-informed circulating tumor (ct)DNA testing reduced adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival in patients with stage II colon cancer. The potential effects of adopting ctDNA testing into routine patient care is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the total cost of patient care scenarios with and without the adoption of ctDNA testing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This budget impact analysis was conducted from the perspectives of US commercial health and Medicare Advantage payers. A decision-analytical model was populated with age-specific incidence of colon cancer, use of adjuvant chemotherapy, and use of single-agent or multiagent regimens. Total cost was estimated with the costs of ctDNA testing, drug acquisition, administration, surveillance, and adverse events. The analysis was conducted from September 2023 to January 2024. EXPOSURES: The adoption of ctDNA testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incremental cost in the first year following the adoption of ctDNA testing, where testing will affect patient treatment and costs. RESULTS: In hypothetical plans with 1 million individuals covered, 35 commercial health plan members and 102 Medicare Advantage members aged 75 years and younger were eligible for ctDNA testing. In the base case with a 50% adoption rate, total cost savings were $221 684 (equivalent to $0.02 per member per month [PMPM]) for a commercial payer and $116 720 (equivalent to $0.01 PMPM) for a Medicare Advantage payer. Cost savings were robust to variations in assumptions of all parameters in the commercial population but sensitive to variations in assumptions of adjuvant chemotherapy use rates in the Medicare Advantage population. The number needed to test to avoid 1 patient receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 4 in the commercial population and 10 in the Medicare Advantage population. The budget-neutral cost for ctDNA testing was $16 202 for a commercial payer and $5793 for a Medicare Advantage payer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in postsurgery patients with stage II colon cancer was projected to result in cost savings for both commercial and Medicare Advantage payers. Adoption of ctDNA testing is therefore advantageous from a budgetary perspective.",bim
11717763,Kongmalai T,Cost-Utility and Budget Impact Analysis of Adding SGLT-2 Inhibitors to Standard Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Heart Failure: Utilizing National Database Insights from Thailand,Pharmacoecon Open,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients poses a significant clinical and financial burden. While sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown cardiovascular benefits in trials, they are not included in Thailand's National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), and their value-for-money remains unassessed. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the cost-utility of adding SGLT2i to the standard treatment for T2D-HF patients in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model with 3-month cycles and a lifetime horizon was conducted from a societal perspective. Efficacy data came from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Transition probabilities and direct medical costs were derived from the National Health Security Office database, while direct non-medical costs and utility were collected through patient interviews at Siriraj hospital to reflect Thailand's context. The main outcomes were incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A sensitivity and budget impact analysis were also performed. RESULTS: Canagliflozin led to the highest increase in QALYs, at 1.21 years, followed by dapagliflozin (0.54 years) and empagliflozin (0.06 years). Collectively, SGLT2i yielded an increase of 0.41 QALYs. Canagliflozin incurred the highest additional treatment cost at United States dollars (US$)5600, followed by dapagliflozin (US$3547) and empagliflozin (US$2694). The ICERs for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and overall SGLT2i were US$4632, US$6430, US$48,952, and US$8480 per QALY gained, respectively. SGLT2i were not cost-effective compared with Thailand's willingness-to-pay threshold of US$4564 per QALY gained. However, threshold analysis indicates that the costs of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and overall SGLT-2i should be reduced by 2.3%, 38.2%, 90.2%, and 55.6%, respectively, to be cost-effective. Budget impact analysis revealed that the total budget for treating T2D patients with HF over 5 years is US$15.6 million. CONCLUSIONS: Adding SGLT2i to standard treatment reduced HF hospitalization and mortality rates and improved QALYs in T2D-HF patients. Nevertheless, they would not be cost-effective at current prices in Thailand.",bim
10793632,Yakti O,Clinical pharmacists’ interventions for preventing adverse events in critically ill neonates in Qatar: an economic impact analysis,J Pharm Policy Pract,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the overall economic impact of clinical pharmacist interventions in the neonatal ICU (NICU) in Qatar. METHODS: A retrospective review of neonates' records was performed over a 3-month duration in the NICU of Qatar to determine the total economic benefit of clinical pharmacist interventions. The total benefit of interventions was calculated by considering the cost avoidance due to preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) and the cost savings associated with the revised resource use due to interventions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the results. RESULTS: A total of 513 interventions were analyzed, involving 150 neonates. Most of the drug-related problems were related to therapy dosing, followed by drug choice appropriateness, the addition of prophylactic treatment, and administration frequency. The overall annual benefit was estimated at QAR 4,178,352 (1,147,584), which consisted of cost avoidance of QAR 1,050,680 (USD 288,648) and an overall cost saving of QAR -6091 (USD -1673). CONCLUSIONS: While the clinical pharmacist interventions led to increased resource utilisation and associated costs, when considering the avoided costs of ADEs, the overall clinical pharmacist practices in the NICU setting were economically beneficial.",bim
11738309,Booth C,PP74 Taking A Lifecycle Approach To Scottish Medicines Consortium Budget Impact Analysis,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2022,"- INTRODUCTION: The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) conducts early health technology assessment of new medicines in Scotland. While budget impact is not a factor in decisions on reimbursement, budget impact information is provided initially through horizon scanning reports for high impact medicines (estimated net budget impact >GBP 500,000 [EUR 585,710] per annum) to aid financial planning and implementation of advice at the local level, and later through budget impact templates from the submitting company issued alongside SMC advice. This research aimed to understand how the information is used and to evaluate the benefits of a lifecycle approach to budget impact analysis. METHODS: Health Board users of the budget impact templates were surveyed to explore the degree of utilization and identify areas for improvement, including the need to cross-validate the horizon scanning estimates with those of the submitting company. Responses were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, with comments coded in Nvivo (QSR International) and themes established through thematic analysis. RESULTS: The initial responses received (n=17) provided representation from 57 percent of Health Boards (i.e., payers) covering 79 percent of the population. Preliminary results showed that while the budget impact templates were valued, 69 percent of respondents found them ‘somewhat useful’, suggesting scope for improvement. Almost half (48%) of the respondents used the templates for high impact medicines, with only 30 percent using them for all medicines. The majority (76%) of those surveyed thought there would be value in linking budget impact information throughout the SMC process. An emerging theme was that some users found the templates complex and inflexible, and that a simpler, more adaptable tool to aid the planning process would be welcomed. Priorities identified for improving template included adapting them to the local population and adjusting medicine prices to reflect confidential discounts. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that budget impact information is valued by Health Boards and that there is strong support for linking budget impact estimates and engaging stakeholders throughout a medicine’s lifecycle. Simplifying the templates, increasing their adaptability, and providing guidance and training in their use will be key steps in improving this important part of SMC process.",bim
11719004,Lloyd M,PP42 Implementing A Sustainable Enhanced Recovery From Surgery Pathway After Hip And Knee Arthroplasty: A Budget Impact Analysis,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Increasing resources are devoted to osteoarthritis surgical care in Australia annually, with significant expenditure attributed to hip and knee arthroplasties. Safe, efficient, and sustainable models of care are required. This study aimed to determine the impact on healthcare costs of implementing an enhanced short-stay model of care (ESS-MOC) for arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: Budget impact analysis was conducted for hospitals providing arthroplasty surgery over the years 2023 to 2030. Population-based sample projections obtained from clinical registry and administrative datasets of individuals receiving hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis were applied. The ESS-MOC assigned 30 percent of eligible patients to a shortened acute-ward-stay pathway and outpatient rehabilitation. The remaining 70 percent received a current practice pathway. The primary outcome was total healthcare cost savings post-implementation of the ESS-MOC, with return on investment (ROI) ratio and hospital bed-days utilized also estimated. Costs are presented in Australian dollars (AUD) and United States dollars (USD), at 2023 prices. RESULTS: Estimated hospital cost savings for the years 2023 to 2030 from implementing the ESS-MOC were AUD641 million (USD427 million) (95% CI: AUD99 million [USD66 million] to AUD1,250 million) [USD834 million]). This corresponds to a ROI ratio of 8.88 (1.3 to 17.9) dollars returned for each dollar invested in implementing the care model. For the period 2023 to 2030, an estimated 337,000 (261,000 to 412,000) acute surgical ward bed-days, and 721,000 (471,000 to 1,028,000) rehabilitation bed-days could be saved. Total implementation costs for the ESS-MOC were estimated at AUD72 million (USD46 million) over eight years. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ESS-MOC for eligible arthroplasty patients in Australia would generate significant cost and healthcare resource savings. This budget impact analysis demonstrates a best practice approach to comprehensively assessing value, at a national level, of implementing sustainable models of care in high-burden healthcare contexts. Findings are relevant to other settings where hospital stay following joint arthroplasty remains excessively long.",bim
11163679,Neppelenbroek E,Antenatal cardiotocography in primary midwife-led care: a budget impact analysis,BMJ Open Qual,2024,"- OBJECTIVES: In many countries, the healthcare sector is dealing with important challenges such as increased demand for healthcare services, capacity problems in hospitals and rising healthcare costs. Therefore, one of the aims of the Dutch government is to move care from in-hospital to out-of-hospital care settings. An example of an innovation where care is moved from a more specialised setting to a less specialised setting is the performance of an antenatal cardiotocography (aCTG) in primary midwife-led care. The aim of this study was to assess the budget impact of implementing aCTG for healthy pregnant women in midwife-led care compared with usual obstetrician-led care in the Netherlands. METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate the actual costs and reimbursement of aCTG performed in midwife-led care and obstetrician-led care (ie, base-case analysis) from the Dutch healthcare perspective. Epidemiological and healthcare utilisation data describing both care pathways were obtained from a prospective cohort, survey and national databases. Different implementation rates of aCTG in midwife-led care were explored. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the budget impact estimates. RESULTS: Shifting aCTG from obstetrician-led care to midwife-led-care would increase actual costs with €311 763 (97.5% CI €188 574 to €426 072) and €1 247 052 (97.5% CI €754 296 to €1 704 290) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively, while it would decrease reimbursement with -€7 538 335 (97.5% CI -€10 302 306 to -€4 559 661) and -€30 153 342 (97.5% CI -€41 209 225 to -€18 238 645) for implementation rates of 25% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis results were consistent with those of the main analysis. CONCLUSIONS: From the Dutch healthcare perspective, we estimated that implementing aCTG in midwife-led care may increase the associated actual costs. At the same time, it might lower the healthcare reimbursement.",bim
10219864,Lodise T,"Budget Impact Analysis of REBYOTA™ (Fecal Microbiota, Live-jslm [FMBL]) for Preventing Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection in the US",Adv Ther,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: Patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) often experience recurrences (rCDI), which are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures. REBYOTA™ (fecal microbiota, live-jslm [FMBL]) is a microbiota-based live biotherapeutic approved for the prevention of rCDI following antibiotic treatment for rCDI. We quantified the budget impact of FMBL during the first 3 years following introduction from a third-party US payer perspective. METHODS: A decision-tree model was used to estimate the budget impact of one-course FMBL by comparing costs under the scenario with FMBL to the scenario without FMBL (standard of care) in patients with one or more (≥ 1) recurrences after a primary episode of CDI and had completed ≥ 1 round of antibiotic treatments. Drug costs, rCDI-related medical costs, and budget impact over 1-3 years were estimated in 2022 US dollars. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For an insurance plan with a population size of 1,000,000, 468 patients per year were estimated to have ≥ 1 rCDI. The budget impact of one-course FMBL at $9000/course was cost-saving at an» average of -$0.0039 on a per-member-per-month (PMPM) basis, an average of -$8.30 on a per-treated-member-per-month (PTMPM) basis, and a total of -$139,865 on a plan level assuming 5%, 15%, and 20% of patients receive FMBL over 1-3 years, respectively. The scenario with FMBL entry was associated with higher drug costs (difference at $0.0474 PMPM; $101.26 PTMPM; $1,706,445 total plan) and lower rCDI-related medical costs (difference at -$0.0513 PMPM; -$109.56 PTMPM; -$1,846,309 total plan). The budget impact of FMBL in patients at first rCDI was cost-saving at -$0.0139 PMPM, -$84.78 PTMPM, corresponding to an annual savings of $500,022. CONCLUSIONS: FMBL has a cost-saving budget impact for a US payer, with higher initial drug costs being offset by savings in rCDI-related medical costs. Greater cost saving was found in patients at first recurrence.",bim
11360725,Imaz-Iglesia I,Updating and Refining of Economic Evaluation of Rotavirus Vaccination in Spain: A Cost–Utility and Budget Impact Analysis,Viruses,2024,"- Two vaccines against rotavirus diseases, Rotarix(®) and RotaTeq(®), are being marketed in Spain; but rotavirus is not presently among the diseases covered by universal vaccination in Spain. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of extending Spain's current targeted rotavirus vaccination strategy including only preterm babies, to a policy of universal vaccination. A de novo cohort-based Markov model was built to evaluate the efficiency of three compared rotavirus vaccination strategies in Spain: targeted, universal, and no vaccination. Using Rotarix(®) or RotaTeq(®), we compared the cost-utility of these strategies from both a societal perspective and Spanish National Health System (SNHS) perspective. The model represents the most important clinical events conceivably linked to rotavirus infection. Efficacy, effectiveness, safety, costs, and utilities were identified by systematic reviews. Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) is EUR 23,638/QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year) for targeted vaccination with Rotarix(®) compared with no vaccination. The ICUR for the rest of the strategies evaluated are above EUR 30,000/QALY. The sensitivity analysis shows price as the only parameter that could make the universal vaccination strategy efficient. Considering a threshold of EUR 25,000/QALY, only targeted vaccination with Rotarix(®) would be efficient from societal perspective. Price drops of 36.9% for Rotarix(®) and 44.6% for RotaTeq(®) would make universal vaccination efficient.",bim
11570051,Delaney C,PP103 Budget Impact Analysis Of Utilization Of WavelinQ Endo-arteriovenous Fistula System For Hemodialysis Patients: An Australian Hospital Perspective,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: A high proportion of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are treated with hemodialysis (HD). To lower morbidity and maintain overall cost control in patients with ESKD, it is crucial for health systems to establish and maintain durable hemodialysis (HD) access. Our objective was to assess the budget impact of utilizing the ‘WavelinQ Endo Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) system’ (WavelinQ) for HD patients. METHODS: A one-year economic model from the Hospital (Flinders Medical Centre, FMC) perspective was developed with Australian epidemiological and costing data. Clinical data were collected from real-world sources. The incident (n=50) and prevalent (n=250) cohorts were based on FMC utilization patterns. The current standard of care was surgical AVF (sAVF) and/or central venous catheters (CVC). With introduction of WavelinQ into practice, the substitution rate was set at 50 percent in new patients and ten percent amongst existing patients. Index procedure and reinterventions costs for the patient were based on the weighted average cost using National Efficient Price Determination 2020 to 21. Total costs preWavelinQ introduction were compared to post WavelinQ substitution to determine the budget impact. RESULTS: Based on FMC expected patient cohort and WavelinQ substitution rates, the mean annual cost savings per incident and prevalent patient were AUD26,873 and AUD3,549, respectively, which lead to overall mean annual cost savings per patient of AUD7,437. The calculated per patient additional upfront cost of AUD7,010 with the WavelinQ index procedure versus sAVF was more than offset by the savings due to less post-procedure reinterventions. Overall, at the assumed substitution rates with WavelinQ, the model predicted a cost saving of approximately AUD2.2 million dollars for FMC. CONCLUSIONS: The use of WavelinQ is expected to lead to cost savings of AUD2.2 million dollars from the FMC perspective. Hospitals should consider not just the increase in upfront costs but also potential savings from less reintervention procedures. There is a need for continued research on the budget impact of different HD modalities across multiple settings.",bim
9664679,Williams J,Universal testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the emergency department: a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of two urban hospitals in the United Kingdom,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of testing for hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in emergency departments (ED), due to the elevated prevalence amongst attendees. The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of universal opt-out HBV and HCV testing in EDs based on 2 long-term studies of the real-world effectiveness of testing in 2 large ED's in the UK. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate ED-based HBV and HCV testing versus no ED testing, in addition to current testing practice. The two EDs had a HBV HBsAg prevalence of 0.5-0.9% and an HCV RNA prevalence of 0.9-1.0%. The analysis was performed from a UK health service perspective, over a lifetime time horizon. Costs are reported in British pounds (GBP), and outcomes as quality adjusted life years (QALYs), with both discounted at 3.5% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) are calculated as costs per QALY gained. A willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY was used. The cost-effectiveness was estimated for both infections, in both ED's. RESULTS: HBV and HCV testing were highly cost-effective in both settings, with ICERs ranging from £7,177 to £12,387 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, HBV testing was 89-94% likely to be cost-effective at the threshold, while HCV testing was 94-100% likely to be cost-effective, across both settings. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, testing remained cost-effective in both locations at ≥ 0.25% HBsAg prevalence, and ≥ 0.49% HCV RNA prevalence. This is much lower than the prevalence observed in the two EDs included in this study. CONCLUSIONS: HBV and HCV testing in urban EDs is highly cost-effective in the UK, and can be cost-effective at relatively low prevalence. These results should be reflected in UK and European hepatitis testing guidelines.",bim
11608167,Wenzel A,Economic effects of next-generation sequencing diagnostics in unspecific sepsis patients – a budget impact analysis from the healthcare providers’ perspective in Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,2024,"- PURPOSE: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools have clinical advantages over blood culture but are more expensive. This study assesses the budget impact and break-even point of NGS testing costs from a healthcare provider's perspective in Germany. METHODS: The budget impact was calculated based on aggregated data of German post-operative surgery cases. Simulated cost savings were calculated based on a simulated reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) of four or eight days with a positivity rate of 71% and compared to the costs of one (scenario A) or two tests (scenario B) per case. Furthermore, the break-even point of the cost of two tests compared to saved costs through shortened LOS was conducted. RESULTS: For 9,450 cases, an average budget impact for scenario A and scenario B of €1,290.41 [95% CI €1,119.64 - €1,461.19] and - €208.59 [95% CI - €379.36 - - €37.81] was identified for gastrointestinal and kidney surgery cases, and €1,355.58 [95% CI €1,049.62 - €1,661.55] and €18.72 [95% CI - €324.69 - €287.24] for vascular artery surgery cases, respectively. The break-even analysis showed that using two tests per case could achieve a minimum positive contribution margin with an average of 1.9 tests per case across the study population. CONCLUSION: The results revealed a positive budget impact for one NGS test and a slightly negative budget impact for two NGS tests per case. Findings suggest that largest cost savings are generated for more severe cases and are highly dependent on the patient population.",bim
10571281,Aungsumart S,Rituximab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in Thailand: an economic evaluation and budget impact analysis,BMC Health Serv Res,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelination process in the central nervous system (CNS) causing neurological disability and poor quality of life. Currently, Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying therapy is costly, and most patients with multiple sclerosis are ineligible for treatment in Thailand as previous studies have challenged its cost-effectiveness. Off-label use of rituximab is inexpensive and highly effective in treating multiple sclerosis, but evidence of its cost-effectiveness in Thailand is yet to be collected. METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and budget impact of rituximab for multiple sclerosis treatment compared with best supportive care, the standard practice in Thailand to treat the disease. A Markov model with a one-month cycle length and lifetime horizon was applied to compare the costs and outcomes of rituximab and best supportive care based on a societal perspective. Accordingly, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate parameter uncertainty. In addition, the Markov model was used to assess the 5-year budget impact from the government perspective. RESULTS: A rituximab biosimilar demonstrated higher effectiveness and lower associated costs, compared to best supportive care, with the highest probability of being cost-effective (96%). The probability of relapse was the most sensitive parameter according to the one-way sensitivity analysis. The calculated budget impact of treating patients with multiple sclerosis in Thailand was 26,360,000 Thai baht (THB) or 844,255 United States dollars (USD) in the first fiscal year, and approximately 20,810,000-23,080,000 THB (666,608-739,388 USD) in the next four fiscal years. CONCLUSION: In Thailand, a rituximab biosimilar would reduce the overall costs of multiple sclerosis treatment and should, therefore, be included in the National List of Essential Medicines.",bim
10032398,Ngan TT,Budget impact analysis of a home-based colorectal cancer screening programme in Malaysia,BMJ Open,2023,"- OBJECTIVES: The 2020-2022 research project 'Colorectal Cancer Screening Intervention for Malaysia' (CRC-SIM) evaluated the implementation of a home-based CRC screening pilot in Segamat District. This budget impact analysis (BIA) assessed the expected changes in health expenditure of the Malaysian Ministry of Health budget in the scenario where the pilot programme was implemented nationwide vs current opportunistic screening. DESIGN: Budget impact analysis. Assumptions and costs in the opportunistic and novel CRC screening scenarios were derived from a previous evaluation of opportunistic CRC screening in community health clinics across Malaysia and the CRC-SIM research project, respectively. SETTING: National level (with supplement analysis for district level). The BIA was conducted from the viewpoint of the federal government and estimated the annual financial impact over a period of 5 years. RESULTS: The total annual cost of the current practice of opportunistic screening was RM1 584 321 (~I$1 099 460) of which 80% (RM1 274 690 or ~I$884 587) was expended on the provision of opportunistic CRC to adults who availed of the service. Regarding the implementation of national CRC screening programme, the net budget impact in the first year was estimated to be RM107 631 959 (~I$74 692 546) and to reach RM148 485 812 (~I$103 043 589) in the fifth year based on an assumed increased uptake of 5% annually. The costs were calculated to be sensitive to the probability of adults who were contactable, eligible and agreeable to participating in the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the BIA provided direct and explicit estimates of the budget changes to when implementing a population-based national CRC screening programme to aid decision making by health services planners and commissioners in Malaysia about whether such programme is affordable within given their budget constraint. The study also illustrates the use and value of the BIA approach in low-income and middle-income countries and resource-constrained settings.",bim
11419898,Qian Z,Environmental and economic impact analysis of levying VOCs environmental protection tax in China,Heliyon,2024,"- China is one of the largest volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitters worldwide. The emission levels of and harm caused by VOCs have attracted much attention. China has implemented multiple policies for VOCs prevention and control but lacks economic control measures for VOCs In this study, the input-output (IO) price model was used to simulate and analyze the emission reduction and economic effects resulting from the imposition of a VOCs environmental protection tax (EPT) in 31 provinces in China. The results show that, first, the collection of a VOCs-EPT can achieve not only VOCs emission reductions but also the synergistic emission reductions of other major pollutants. Second, the collection of a VOCs-EPT could have a negative impact on the macroeconomy, i.e., the greater the tax scope and the higher the tax rate are, the greater the negative economic impact. Third, differences in the level of economic development, the structure of pollution emissions and the stringency of tax policies among regions would cause the emission reduction effect and related negative economic impact to vary across regions. Finally, the collection of a VOCs-EPT could have heterogeneous impacts on various industries, as high-emission industries would suffer greater negative impacts. Therefore, each region should set tax rates that match its provincial economic and environmental development levels. Furthermore, a VOCs-EPT can be levied on key industries, and reasonable preferential tax policies can be formulated to reduce negative macroeconomic benefits.",bim
10240781,Harris A,"A budget impact analysis of cost to implement a whole child health focused, family-based intervention in primary care for children with elevated BMI",Implement Sci Commun,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Although the cost of implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) is a key determinant of adoption, lack of cost information is widespread. We previously evaluated the cost of preparing to implement Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), an individually tailored, evidence-based parenting program that takes a whole child approach, with effects on both behavioral health and health behavior outcomes, in primary care settings. This study estimates the cost of implementation, including preparation. METHODS: We assessed the cost of FCU4Health across the preparation and implementation phases spanning 32 months and 1 week (October 1, 2016-June 13, 2019) in a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study. This family-level randomized controlled trial took place in Arizona with n = 113 predominantly low-income, Latino families with children ages > 5.5 to < 13 years. Using electronic cost capture and time-based activity-driven methods, budget impact analysis from the perspective of a future FCU4Health adopting entity-namely, ambulatory pediatric care clinicians-was used to estimate the cost of implementation. Labor costs were based on 2021 Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics, NIH-directed salary cap levels or known salaries, plus fringe benefits at a standard rate of 30%. Non-labor costs were based on actual amounts spent from receipts and invoices. RESULTS: The cost of FCU4Health implementation to 113 families was $268,886 ($2380 per family). Actual per family cost varied widely, as individual tailoring resulted in families receiving a range of 1-15 sessions. The estimated cost of replicating implementation for future sites ranged from $37,636-$72,372 ($333-$641 per family). Using our previously reported preparation costs (i.e., $174,489; $1544 per family), with estimated replication costs of $18,524-$21,836 ($164-$193 per family), the total cost of delivering FCU4Health was $443,375 ($3924 per family), with total estimated replication costs of $56,160-$94,208 ($497-$834 per family). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a baseline for costs associated with implementation of an individually tailored parenting program. Results provide critical information for decision makers and a model for future economic analysis and can be used to inform optimization thresholds for implementation and, when necessary, benchmarks for program adaptation to promote scale-up. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered on January 6, 2017, at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03013309).",bim
10597971,Ken-Opurum J,Budget Impact Analysis of Intensification with iGlarLixi Compared to Alternative Treatment Strategies Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetes Ther,2023,"- INTRODUCTION: The clinical benefits of treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with fixed-ratio combination of insulin iGlar (iGlar) plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) were demonstrated in clinical trials and real-world evidence studies; however, its cost impact to healthcare payers is unknown. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed from a United States (US) payer's perspective for a hypothetical healthcare plan of 1 million people over a 1-year time horizon. In scenario analysis, patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) treated with 60 units or less of daily insulin (insulin cohort) or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) only (OAD cohort) were intensified to iGlarLixi/rapid-acting insulin (RAI)/glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or iGlarLixi/iGlar/GLP-1RA, respectively. Model inputs from real-world data (RWD) included baseline market shares, proportion of patients intensifying to respective treatments, and dosing inputs; unit costs were obtained from published literature. One-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of individual parameters. RESULTS: Intensification with iGlarLixi resulted in the lowest incremental per member per month (PMPM) budget impact compared to other intensifying drugs (iGlar, RAI, and GLP-1RA). In the insulin cohort, the incremental PMPM cost for intensification with iGlarLixi ($0.03) was the lowest among intensifying drugs; GLP-1RA ($72.20) and RAI ($4.81). Similarly, the incremental PMPM cost for intensification with iGlarLixi was the lowest ($1.25) in the OAD cohort among intensifying drugs; GLP-1RA ($321.65) and iGlar ($114.82). In scenario analyses, when equal market intensification shares for iGlarLixi and GLP-1RA were explored, the incremental PMPM cost for iGlarLixi ($0.03) remained lower than GLP-1RA ($2.28) and RAI ($10.44) in the insulin cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Intensification with iGlarLixi was associated with lower costs compared to other treatment intensifications, as well as overall budget reductions compared to pre-intensification when considering cost savings attributable to reduction in HbA1c; therefore, its inclusion for the treatment of T2DM would represent a budget saving.",bim
11616323,Lloyd M,Implementing an enhanced recovery from surgery pathway to reduce hospital length of stay for primary hip or knee arthroplasty: a budget impact analysis,BMC Health Serv Res,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Given growing demand for hip and knee arthroplasty and unsustainable resource requirements, safe and efficient models of care are critical. This study aims to determine the impact on healthcare costs of implementing an enhanced short-stay model of care (ESS-MOC) for arthroplasty at a national level. METHODS: A budget impact analysis was conducted for the years 2023-2030 in the setting of Australian publicly and privately funded hospitals performing hip or knee arthroplasty. The model considered population-based future arthroplasty projections, published data on healthcare costs and resource utilisation, and aggregate health insurer claims data related to minor complexity elective hip or knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. The ESS-MOC assigned a conservative hypothesized 30% of eligible patients to an enhanced recovery from surgery (ERAS) pathway which comprised a shortened acute ward stay (average 2 days versus 4 days with current care) and outpatient rehabilitation. The primary outcome was total healthcare cost savings post-ESS-MOC implementation, stratified by joint (knee/hip) and healthcare sector (public/private). Return on investment (ROI) ratio, measuring the return for each dollar invested in implementation, and hospital bed days utilized, were also estimated. Costs are presented in Australian dollars (AUD), at 2023 prices. RESULTS: Estimated cost savings for 2023-2030 from implementing the ESS-MOC pathway were AUD641 million (95% CI: AUD99 million to AUD1250 million), corresponding to a ROI ratio of AUD8.88 (AUD1.3 to AUD17.9). Total implementation costs for the ESS-MOC were estimated at AUD38 million and AUD34 million for the private and public sectors, respectively. Savings would be 8-fold higher in the private sector (AUD571 million vs. AUD70 million in the public sector), primarily attributable to the > 80,000 rehabilitation bed days saved annually in this sector. For the period 2023-2030, an estimated 337,000 (261,000 to 412,000) acute bed days could be saved (private sector 262,000 [200,000 to 324,000]; public sector 74,000 [57,000 to 92,000]). Less than 10% of eligible patients would need to move into the ERAS pathway to realise cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an enhanced short-stay model of care for eligible arthroplasty patients in Australia would generate significant cost and resource savings, particularly for the private hospital sector.",bim
11801450,Gong CL,Budget Impact Analysis of Integrative Medicine Practices for Pediatric Patients With Chronic Pain,Clin J Pain,2025,"- OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain is a leading cause of morbidity in children and adolescents globally but can be managed with a combination of traditional Western medicine and integrative medicine (IM) practices. This combination has improved various critical health outcomes, such as quality of life, sleep, pain, anxiety, and health care utilization. These IM practices include acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback, massage, mindfulness, or any combination of these modalities. The current article﻿ developed a budget impact model to estimate the institutional costs of implementing these practices among adolescents. METHODS: A decision tree was used to estimate the reduction in hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) use based on a previously published retrospective analysis of children receiving IM practices comparing utilization rates 1-year pre-implementation and post-implementation of IM services (Figure 1). Costs associated with implementing each modality were based on hourly compensation rates for licensed professionals administering each service and equipment associated with delivery (eg, acupuncture needles, biofeedback equipment, and sensors). The cost of each hospitalization and ED visit was derived from the literature. In addition, cost savings were estimated based on government-contracted and commercial-contracted reimbursement rates for each service. RESULTS: Cost savings were approximated to range from $1344 to $3439 per patient, with even greater cost savings of up to $6000 and $4132 when accounting for governmental and commercial payer reimbursement, respectively. DISCUSSION: IM leads to improved pain relief when combined with traditional medicine and yields significant cost savings, thus supporting the routine implementation of IM alongside traditional medicine in health care settings.",bim
10977723,Lopes da Silva Filho A,Etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant: Budget impact analysis based on the Brazilian private healthcare system,PLoS One,2024,"- High rates of unplanned pregnancies persist despite pharmacological developments and advancements in contraceptive methods. Here, we demonstrate that the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal contraceptive implant (IMP-ETN) may be an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) for women in Brazil. For our pharmacoeconomic analysis, we reviewed the literature on IMP-ETN regarding its acceptance, eligibility criteria, choice, relations with age, adverse events and, finally, the unmet need in the fee-for-service private healthcare sector. We considered qualitative observations in combination with quantitative analysis and performed a deterministic sensitivity analysis to investigate whether this technology can be self-sustainable over a period of five years. The target population for this analysis comprised 158,696 women. Compared with the continued use of LNG-IUSs, adopting the IMP-ETN can result in a cost avoidance of $ 7.640.804,02 in the first year and $ 82,455,254.43 in five years. Disseminating information among physicians will promote this change and strengthen the potential cost avoided by private health system payers. These savings can be used to improve other healthcare programs and strategies. Moreover, the principles of care can be promoted by improving and adapting healthcare systems and expanding treatment and follow-up strategies. This would also provide support to women's reproductive rights and improve their quality of life. Our results suggest that the IMP-ETN has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile. Given all its advantages and negative incremental cost impact over a period of five years, the IMP-ETN may be a more favorable alternative to LNG-IUSs. Therefore, it should be offered to beneficiaries with a private healthcare plan. This analysis overcomes previous barriers to the use of cost-benefit models, and our results may help balance decision-making by policymakers, technical consultants, and researchers.",bim
11772286,Permsuwan U,Budget impact analysis of insulin glargine vs. isophane protamine insulin treatment for patients with type-2 diabetes and severe hypoglycemia in Thailand,Front Public Health,2025,"- OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the financial impact of different adoption rates of insulin glargine (IGlar) treatment compared to isophane protamine (neutral protamine hagedorn [NPH]) insulin treatment for patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D) and severe hypoglycemia in Thailand from the payer's perspective. METHODS: The budget impact analysis (BIA) model over a period of 5 years was used to estimate the net budget impact (NBI) of IGlar treatment by comparing the total budget expenditures under two scenarios: scenario 1 involved only NPH insulin and scenario 2 included the introduction of IGlar. The total budget included either the cost of insulin or a combination of the costs of insulin and the expense related to severe hypoglycemia. Scenario 2 started at 20% uptake of IGlar and a yearly increase of 20%. NBI was calculated as the difference between the total budgets of scenarios 1 and 2. NBI and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted for evaluation. RESULTS: Considering only the cost of insulin, the use of IGlar for patients with T2D and severe hypoglycemia resulted in a yearly average NBI of 174.9 million Thai baht (THB) (5.1 million USD). However, when the cost related to severe hypoglycemia was included, the total budget incurred from scenario 2 was less than that of scenario 1, leading to a negative NBI or cost savings. CONCLUSION: The NBI of IGlar adoption would be substantial when considering only the cost of insulin; however, the significant benefit of IGlar in terms of a lower rate of severe hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin would clearly offset the additional cost of IGlar.",bim

METHODS: We estimated the population of adult Pakistani migrants registered at the primary care centres in Catalonia by means of the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (n=37 972 in 2019, Barcelona health area). This cohort was followed for a time period of 10 years after HCV diagnosis (2019-2028). The statistical significance of the differences observed in the anti-HCV positivity rate between screened and non-screened was confirmed (α=0.05). The budget impact was calculated from the perspective of the Catalan Department of Health. Sensitivity analyses included different levels of participation in HepClink: pessimistic, optimistic and maximum. RESULTS: The HepClink scenario screened a higher percentage of individuals (69.8%) compared with the current scenario of HCV care (39.7%). Viraemia was lower in the HepClink scenario compared with the current scenario (1.7% vs 2.5%, respectively). The budget impact of the HepClink scenario was €884 244.42 in 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up the HepClink strategy to the whole Catalan territory infers a high budget impact for the Department of Health and allows increasing the detection of viraemia (+17.8%) among Pakistani migrants ≥18 years. To achieve a sustainable elimination of HCV by improving screening and treatment rates, there is room for improvement at two levels. First, taking advantage of the fact that 68.08% of the Pakistani population had visited their primary care physicians to reinforce targeted screening in primary care. Second, to use HepClink at the community level to reach individuals with reluctance to use healthcare services.",bim

It can reactivate following immunosuppression causing diverse clinical manifestations. In immunocompetent individuals, CMV infections are usually asymptomatic. However, in immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus, CMV infections can cause serious complications. Antiviral treatment is crucial for minimizing health risks and preventing severe outcomes, such as retinitis and colitis, in this population. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a decision tree model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ganciclovir (1 mg/mL) for people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) affected by CMV-related retinitis or colitis. The model compared ganciclovir therapy to no ganciclovir, with the outcome being progression of CMV disease. Budget impact was considered over a five-year time frame with 100 percent diffusion among patients with AIDS and CMV-related colitis. RESULTS: In patients with AIDS and CMV-related retinitis, use of ganciclovir incurred an incremental cost of BRL29,378.95 (USD5,188.70) with an incremental effectiveness of 0.51 in the therapeutic response rate and an ICER of BRL57,605.79 (USD10,173.93). For those with AIDS and CMV-related colitis, ganciclovir incurred an incremental cost of BRL10,040.71 (USD1,773.32), with an incremental effectiveness of 0.26 and an ICER of BRL38,618.11 (USD6,820.45). The estimated cumulative budget impact, considering 100 percent ganciclovir diffusion over five years, was BRL1,124,800,751.17 (USD198,654,342.23) and BRL571,223,309.75 (USD100,885,415.26) for patients with AIDS CMV-related retinitis and colitis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The application of economic evaluation and budget impact tools is crucial for maintaining health system sustainability. Introducing treatments with high ICERs and budget impact can jeopardize the health system and access to treatments. Upholding criteria, such as the willingness-to-pay threshold, is essential for ensuring the sustainability and continuity of health care.",bim
10961941,Danielson EC,Implementation Preparation Costs of Virtual Reality Job Interview Training in Prisons: A Budget Impact Analysis,J Offender Rehabil,2023,"- Virtual Reality Job Interview Training (VR-JIT) has increased employment rates for returning citizens when added to a successful prison-based employment readiness program. However, implementation preparation cost-expenses prior to offering VR-JIT to intended recipients-is unknown. We estimated the cost of implementation preparation activities (e.g., organizing workflow) for two prisons to deliver VR-JIT. We conducted a budget impact analysis and enumerated the labor costs incurred during this important stage of implementation. Labor costs were approximately $8,847 per prison. Our sensitivity analysis estimated the labor costs to replicate this effort in a new prison to range from $2,877 to $4,306 per prison. Thus, VR-JIT may be an affordable tool for prison-based employment readiness programs to improve gainful employment.",bim
10721756,Lopes LP,Budget Impact Analysis of Risperidone Use and Adverse Event Monitoring in Autism Spectrum Disorder in Brazil: Assessment of Theoretical Versus Real Data,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Risperidone is used in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to manage aggressive behavior. Budget impact analysis (BIA) assists managers in promoting more sustainable health systems; however, it is unclear whether BIAs underestimate or overestimate the estimates derived from real-world data. This study aimed to compare the estimated BIA values of risperidone use and the monitoring of adverse events in ASD using theoretical and real data. METHODS: Analyses were conducted based on the clinical protocol and the Brazilian therapeutic guidelines for ASD. The perspective adopted was that of the Unified Health System (SUS), considering a time horizon of 5 years. Three possible scenarios were considered based on the maximum daily dose of risperidone. Expenses related to the acquisition of risperidone and the monitoring of adverse events were taken into account using health databases in Brazil. For the calculation based on theoretical data, the prevalence of ASD was estimated using information from the scientific literature and the Brazilian demographic census. The model calculated from real data was obtained by analyzing the linear trend of the number of users assisted in the SUS from 2017 to 2021. RESULTS: The population estimated by the theoretical model compared with the model calculated from the real data was higher. Likewise, the 5-year budgetary impact of the theoretical model versus the model calculated from the real data was higher, with statistical significance in all scenarios (p < 0.001). In the real data model, the most economically advantageous scenarios were Scenario 1 for children (International dollars [I$] 7,630,040.73) and Scenario 3 for adults (I$60,329,288.17). Estimated expenditures for monitoring adverse events ranged from 17 to 74% in children and from 50% to 63% in adults. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed significant differences in population and cost estimation between theoretical data and real-world data. The expenses associated with monitoring adverse events represented a substantial expenditure estimate for the SUS.",bim
11187468,Tang T,Estimating the Economic Impact of Levalbuterol’s Potential Transition From the National Reimbursement Drug List for the Treatment of Pediatric Asthma in China: A Budget Impact Analysis,Cureus,2024,"- Background Levalbuterol is a short-acting β(2)-agonist (SABA) indicated for treating or preventing asthma exacerbation. It was included in the 2020 Chinese National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). This study estimates the economic impact of levalbuterol's status change within and withdrawal from the NRDL in treating pediatric asthma from a publicly funded medical insurance perspective. Methodology A prevalence-based budget impact model was developed. The analysis compared a world with a levalbuterol scenario to a world without levalbuterol. Epidemiological data were obtained from the existing literature. Cost data were estimated based on the drug dosage in clinical trials, real-world settings, and expert opinions. Scenario analysis considered the same length of stay (LOS) in the two groups. One-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to show the impact of varying individual parameters. Results In the base-case analysis, compared to the world without scenario, the preservation of levalbuterol resulted in cost savings of ¥82.8 million in China over three years. In the scenario analysis, savings decreased to ¥76.1 million over three years. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for the most part, the results were robust to changes in input parameter values. Conclusions Using levalbuterol may lead to substantial cost savings for Chinese society.",bim
11718668,Gargano L,PP14 Recombinant Human Erythropoietin For Sickle Cell Disease And Brazilian Healthcare System Sustainability: Cost-Effectiveness And Budget Impact Analysis,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2025,"- INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a rare disease, including renal complications. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (i.e., recombinant human erythropoietin, rHuEPO) are recommended for SCD and renal impairment. Evidence suggests its effectiveness in raising hemoglobin (Hb), which may reduce the need for regular blood transfusions. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis (BIA) of rHuEPO were performed from the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) perspective. METHODS: A decision tree was created to assess rHuEPO’s impact on reducing blood transfusions. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for transfusion dependency and direct medical costs related to rHuEPO and transfusion were considered. SCD patients with worsening kidney function and Hb levels enter the model with an indication of receiving regular transfusions; those who proceed to the rHuEPO+standard care arm are likely to have clinically relevant elevation in Hb levels (i.e., <1.5 g/dL), suspending transfusions, and those who do not respond to treatment continue to receive regular transfusions. BIA population was estimated based on epidemiological data, considering direct costs over a five-year horizon. RESULTS: rHuEPO+standard care compared to standard care generated 36.8 percent less need for transfusions, resulting in an increase of 0.033 QALY and a saving of BRL11,564 (USD2,362) per patient/year. rHuEPO was the dominant alternative; that is, there was greater clinical benefit and lower total cost. At BIA, the eligible population was 5,274 patients per year, on average. The direct cost of acquiring rHuEPO for the total eligible population summed BRL13,737,129 (USD2,806,016) in five years. However, considering the estimated effectiveness of CEA in reducing transfusions, BIA demonstrated savings of BRL96,545,791 (USD19,720,936) accumulated over five years. CONCLUSIONS: Health technology assessments showing the new alternative as dominant are uncommon, especially in rare diseases, where patented orphan drugs usually have increased costs, which is not the case of rHuEPO. In this analysis, rHuEPO remained the dominant alternative and its incorporation would result in savings that may contribute to the sustainability of the Sistema Único de Saúde, Brazil’s national health system.",bim
10902956,Goudarzi Z,"Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of Daratumumab, Lenalidomide and dexamethasone for relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma",Cost Eff Resour Alloc,2024,"- BACKGROUND: The prominent efficacy in terms of increasing progression-free survival (PFS) of Daratumumab, Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) triplet therapy versus Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) was proven previously in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, the cost effectiveness of DRd versus KRd is unknown. METHODS: We developed a Markov model by using an Iranian payer perspective and a 10-year time horizon to estimate the healthcare cost, Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years gain (LYG) for DRd and KRd triplet therapies. Clinical data were obtained from meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess model uncertainty. Budget impact analysis of 5 years of treatment under the DRd triplet therapy was also analysed. RESULTS: DRd was estimated to be more effective compared to KRd, providing 0.28 QALY gain over the modelled horizon. DRd-treated patients incurred $264 in total additional costs. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) and cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were $956/QALY and $472/LYG respectively. The budget impact analysis indicates that adding Daratumumab to Lenalidomide and dexamethasone regimen, in the first 5 years, will increase the healthcare system's expenses by $6.170.582. CONCLUSION: DRd triplet therapy compared to KRd is a cost-effective regimen for RRMM under Iran willingness-to-pay threshold.",bim
11280244,Armijo N,Budget impact analysis of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III non–small cell lung cancer in the context of the Chilean health care system,PLoS One,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Durvalumab, used as consolidation immunotherapy, has shown to improve survival in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer who respond to chemoradiotherapy, based on the most recent follow-up of PACIFIC. The Chilean healthcare system provides access to certain immunotherapies for this condition. The present study sought to estimate the budget impact of durvalumab versus standard of care in the context of the Chilean healthcare system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was adapted to compare two strategies: durvalumab as consolidation therapy and standard of care for treating stage III NSCLC. The number of patients eligible for treatment was estimated using published incidence data and modeled for a 5-year time horizon. Model inputs were based on published literature, and the duration of treatment was estimated using survival curves obtained from PACIFIC. Costs were estimated in Chilean pesos (CLP) and converted to USD dollars using an exchange rate of USD 1  =  CLP 827. Scenario analyses were performed to assess different subsequent therapy splits, variations in the target population and dosage of durvalumab. RESULTS: Durvalumab uptake projected total costs ranging from USD 1.27 in Year 1 to 8.5 million in Year 5 from the public perspective. From the private perspective, the budget impact for the first year is USD 1.3 million to USD 3 million for 2028. This difference relies mostly on the lower number of patients treated. Both perspectives anticipated cost savings over the time horizon through reduced monitoring, adverse events, and end-of-life expenses. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the inclusion of Durvalumab for NSCLC in Chile represents an investment in the Chilean health system. The incremental costs align with clinical benefits and potential savings in healthcare resource utilization. However, a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to evaluate its economic value thoroughly.",bim
11329540,Cortesi PA,Health and economic impact of dapagliflozin for type 2 diabetes patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the Italian general practitioners setting: a budget impact analysis,Acta Diabetol,2024,"- AIM: In 2022, in Italy, general practitioners (GPs) have been allowed to prescribe SGLT2i in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) under National Health Service (NHS) reimbursement. In the pivotal clinical trial named DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, CV death and kidney disease progression compared to placebo in a population of T2D patients. This study evaluated the health and economic impact of dapagliflozin for T2D patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the Italian GPs setting. METHODS: A budget impact model was developed to assess the health and economic impact of introducing dapagliflozin in GPs setting. The analysis was conducted by adopting the Italian NHS perspective and a 3-year time horizon. The model estimated and compared the health outcomes and direct medical costs associated with a scenario with dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic therapies available for GPs prescription (scenario B) and a scenario where only other antidiabetic therapies are available (scenario A). Rates of occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complications as well as adverse events were captured from DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and the literature, while cost data were retrieved from the Italian tariff and the literature. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of model parameters on the budget impact. RESULTS: The model estimated around 442.000 patients eligible for the treatment with dapagliflozin in the GPs setting for each simulated year. The scenario B compared to scenario A was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complication (-1.83%) over the 3 years simulated. Furthermore, the scenario A allowed for an overall cost saving of 102,692,305€: 14,521,464€ in the first year, 33,007,064€ in the second and 55,163,777€ in the third. The cost of cost of drug acquisition, the probability of cardiovascular events and the percentage of patients potentially eligible to the treatment were the factor with largest impact on the results. CONCLUSIONS: The use of dapagliflozin in GPs setting reduce the number of CVD events, kidney disease progression and healthcare costs in Italy. These data should be considered to optimize the value produced for the T2D patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",bim
11749450,Hadnorntun P,Botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of patients with post-stroke spasticity in Thailand: cost-utility and budget impact analysis,BMJ Open,2025,"- OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-utility of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) for treating upper limb (UL) and lower limb (LL) post-stroke spasticity. DESIGN: Using a Markov model, adopting a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon with a 3% annual discount rate, the cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare BoNT-A combined with standard of care (SoC) with SoC alone. Costs, utilities, transitional probabilities and treatment efficacy were derived from 5-year retrospective data from tertiary hospitals and meta-analysis. Uncertainty analyses were performed. SETTING: Tertiary hospitals in Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: Cohort of post-stroke patients aged 55 years with UL or LL spasticity and a Modified Ashworth Scale score ≥1+. INTERVENTIONS: BoNT-A (abobotulinumtoxinA: aboBoNT-A, onabotulinumtoxinA: onaBoNT-A or prabotulinumtoxinA: praBoNT-A) combined with SoC versus SoC alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of 160 000 THB (US$4468) per QALY gained. RESULTS: The combination of aboBoNT-A and SoC yielded the highest QALYs gained (0.013 for UL and 0.11 for LL), followed by onaBoNT-A and SoC and praBoNT-A and SoC. The additional costs for treating UL and LL cases were highest for onaBoNT-A US$75 and US$95, respectively, followed by aboBoNT-A and praBoNT-A. ICER values for treating UL with aboBoNT-A, onaBoNT-A and praBoNT-A ranged from US$4669 to US$7541 per QALY. For LL treatments, aboBoNT-A and onaBoNT-A had ICER values ranging from US$7072 to US$15 182 per QALY. Integrating BoNT-A treatment delivery into the healthcare system would require a budget outlay of approximately US$413 246-US$966 103 that may vary annually by an additional US$50 260-US$335 064. CONCLUSION: BoNT-A effectively reduces focal spasticity and improves quality of life in post-stroke patients. However, its cost-effectiveness in Thailand necessitates price negotiations as a condition for inclusion in the pharmaceutical reimbursement list.",bim
11416454,Nagano M,Public Health and Economic Impact of Periodic COVID-19 Vaccination with BNT162b2 for Old Adults and High-Risk Patients in an Illustrative Prefecture of Japan: A Budget Impact Analysis,Infect Dis Ther,2024,"- INTRODUCTION: Japan will be transitioning from the free-of-charge COVID-19 vaccination program to annual periodic vaccination under a national immunization program for old adults and high-risk patients from 2024 fall/winter season. The policy transition including out-of-pocket payment requirement may discourage vaccination, leading to a lower vaccination rate. This study aimed to estimate the impact of varying vaccination rates with BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine on economics and public health in an illustrative prefecture which administers and promotes the periodic vaccination program, using budget impact analysis. METHODS: A combined cohort Markov decision tree model estimated the public health outcomes of COVID-19-related symptomatic cases, hospitalizations and deaths; and the economic outcomes including vaccine-related cost, non-vaccine-related medical cost, and productivity loss from the societal perspective. The base case examined the impact on the outcomes when vaccination coverage changed from the reference value of 50% to upper and lower values, respectively. Scenario analyses were performed based on multiple scenarios. RESULTS: Increase in the vaccination rate demonstrated improvement in all public health outcomes. At 50% vaccination, the vaccine-related cost for 3 years in a prefecture was estimated at JPY 7.58 billion (USD 57.67 million), the non-vaccine-related medical cost at JPY 79.22 billion (USD 602.48 million), the productivity loss at JPY 253.11 billion (USD 1.92 billion), and the total cost at JPY 339.92 billion (USD 2.59 billion). When the vaccination rate increased to 90%, the total cost decreased by JPY 4.88 billion (USD 37.11 million) (1.4%). When the vaccination rate decreased to 10%, the total cost increased by JPY 5.73 billion (USD 43.58 million) (1.7%). Results were consistent across almost all scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining a high vaccination rate with BNT162b2 is important from both public health and economic perspectives in Japan. The findings highlight to local governments the importance of continued effort to promote vaccination.",bim
10893703,Dams J,Budget impact analysis of a Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program for older people in Germany: a Markov model based on data from the LiFE-is-LiFE trial,BMC Geriatr,2024,"- BACKGROUND: Fall prevention is important for healthy ageing, but the economic impact of fall prevention are scarcely investigated. A recent cost-effectiveness analysis compared a group-delivered Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise Program (gLiFE) with an individually-delivered program (LiFE) in community-dwelling people (aged ≥ 70 years) at risk of falling. In addition, the current study aimed to analyze the budget impact of LiFE and gLiFE, compared with standard care in Germany. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to reflect falls and associated care needs for community-dwelling persons over 5 years. The intervention effects of LiFE and gLiFE were shown to be equivalent in a non-inferiority trial, although the costs differed. Outpatient, inpatient, and intervention costs were assessed from a payer's perspective. The effect of parameter uncertainty was assessed in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The budget impact due to intervention costs was €510 million for LiFE and €186 million for gLiFE. Over five years, health care expenditures were €35,008 million for those receiving standard care, €35,416 million for those receiving LiFE, and €35,091 million for persons receiving gLiFE. Thereby, LiFE and gLiFE could prevent 2700 deaths and 648,000 falls over 5 years. Parameter uncertainties in the risk of falling, uptake of an intervention offer, and in the intervention effects had a major influence; thus cost savings for LiFE and gLiFE compared with standard care could be achieved for individuals with a high risk of falling. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that cost savings for LiFE and gLiFE compared with standard care could only be achieved for individuals at high risk of falling, with gLiFE being superior to LiFE. Future research should consider benefits and aspects of fall prevention beyond falls (e.g., physical activity, social aspects, and personal preferences of participants).

9652901,Mar J,Budget impact analysis of the use of Souvenaid in patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease in Spain,Alzheimers Res Ther,2022,"- INTRODUCTION: The effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the use of Souvenaid for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been previously evidenced. To complete the economic analysis, there is a need to assess whether society can afford it. The objective of this study was to carry out a budget impact analysis of the use of Souvenaid in Spain under the conditions of the LipiDidiet clinical trial from a societal perspective. METHODS: We built a population model that took into account all the cohorts of individuals with AD, their individual progression, and the potential impact of Souvenaid treatment on their trajectories. Patient progression data were obtained from mixed models. The target population was estimated based on the population forecast for 2020-2035 and the incidence of dementia. Individual progression to dementia measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes was reproduced using mixed models. Besides the costs of treatment and diagnosis, direct costs of medical and non-medical care and indirect costs were included. RESULTS: The epidemiological indicators and the distribution of life expectancy by stages validated the model. From the third year (2022), the differences in the cost of dementia offset the incremental cost of diagnosis and treatment. The costs of dependency reached €500 million/year while those of the intervention were limited to €40 million. CONCLUSIONS: Souvenaid, with modest effectiveness in delaying dementia associated with AD, achieved a positive economic balance between costs and savings. Its use in the treatment of prodromal AD would imply an initial cost that would be ongoing, but this would be offset by savings in the care system for dependency associated with dementia from the third year. These results were based on adopting a societal perspective taking into account the effect of treatment on the use of health, social, and family resources.",bim
10373014,Siddiqui ZA,Cost impact of different treatment regimens of brolucizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: A budget impact analysis,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Brolucizumab is a new anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) approved for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Multiple treatment regimens are available for treating nAMD. These regimens include manufacturer-recommended regimens, pro re nata (PRN) regimens, and treat-and-extend (T&E) regimens, which are based on clinical practice guidelines and data observed in the real-world clinical setting, classified as real-world evidence (RWE). Most budget impact models predict the financial consequences of adding a new drug to the formulary based on the manufacturer-recommended regimen. With different anti-VEGF treatment regimens being used in nAMD by ophthalmologists, it is OBJECTIVE: To estimate the budget impact of different treatment regimens of brolucizumab in nAMD from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based budget impact model was developed for different treatment regimens of brolucizumab over a 1-year time frame from a US payer perspective. A separate analysis was performed to estimate the budget impact from a US patient population perspective. Model inputs included drug costs, administration costs, physician visit costs, and disease monitoring costs. Outcomes in the budget impact model included the cost per member per month, annual health plan cost, and the US patient population-based annual cost. Based on the prevalence of nAMD in public and commercial health plans, a scenario analysis was conducted on the US population to account for the differences in the drug cost to the public and commercial payers. Further, 1-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model assumptions and uncertainty in model inputs. RESULTS: The addition of brolucizumab to the formulary increased the net budgetary impact under PRN and T&E regimens. The maximum increase in expenditure for a hypothetical health plan with 1 million enrollees was associated with the PRN regimen ($824,696), followed by the T&E regimen ($163,101). In contrast, using the manufacturer-recommended and RWE regimens led to an annual saving of $93,068 and $94,170 for the health plan, respectively. In the US patient population model, the introduction of brolucizumab resulted in savings in the manufacturer-recommended ($30.99 million) and RWE regimens ($31.35 million) but led to an increase in annual expenditures for the PRN ($274.58 million) and T&E ($54.30 million) regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Payers need to evaluate the cost impact of different treatment regimens of existing and new anti-VEGFs when making formulary decisions in nAMD management.

10442735,Makan H,"Clinical and Economic Assessment of MyDiaCare, Digital Tools Combined With Diabetes Nurse Educator Support, for Managing Diabetes in South Africa: Observational Multicenter, Retrospective Study Associated With a Budget Impact Model",JMIR Form Res,2023,"- BACKGROUND: In South Africa, diabetes prevalence is expected to reach 5.4 million by 2030. In South Africa, diabetes-related complications severely impact not only patient health and quality of life but also the economy. OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Nurse Educator (DNE) study assessed the benefit of adding the MyDiaCare program to standard of care for managing patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in South Africa. An economic study was also performed to estimate the budget impact of adding MyDiaCare to standard of care for patients with type 2 diabetes older than 19 years treated in the South African private health care sector. METHODS: The real-world DNE study was designed as an observational, retrospective, multicenter, single-group study. Eligible patients were older than 18 years and had at least 6 months of participation in the MyDiaCare program. The MyDiaCare program combines a patient mobile app and a health care professional platform with face-to-face visits with a DNE. The benefit of MyDiaCare was assessed by the changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, the proportion of patients achieving clinical and biological targets, adherence to care plans, and satisfaction after 6 months of participating in the MyDiaCare program. A budget impact model was performed using data from the DNE study and another South African cohort of the DISCOVERY study to estimate the economic impact of MyDiaCare. RESULTS: Between November 25, 2019, and June 30, 2020, a total of 117 patients (8 with type 1 diabetes and 109 with type 2 diabetes) were enrolled in 2 centers. After 6 months of MyDiaCare, a clinically relevant decrease in mean HbA(1c) levels of 0.6% from 7.8% to 7.2% was observed. Furthermore, 54% (43/79) of patients reached or maintained their HbA(1c) targets at 6 months. Most patients achieved their targets for blood pressure (53/79, 67% for systolic and 70/79, 89% for diastolic blood pressure) and lipid parameters (49/71, 69% for low-density-lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, 41/71, 58% for high-density-lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and 59/71, 83% for total cholesterol), but fewer patients achieved their targets for triglycerides (32/70, 46%), waist circumference (12/68, 18%), and body weight (13/76, 17%). The mean overall adherence to the MyDiaCare care plan was 93%. Most patients (87/117, 74%) were satisfied with the MyDiaCare program. The net budget impact per patient with type 2 diabetes, older than 19 years, treated in the private sector using MyDiaCare was estimated to be approximately South African Rands (ZAR) 71,023 (US $4089) during the first year of introducing MyDiaCare. CONCLUSIONS: The results of using MyDiaCare program, which combines digital tools for patients and health care professionals with DNE support, suggest that it may be a clinically effective and cost-saving solution for diabetes management in the South African private health care sector.",bim
11603808,Saweri OP,What does it cost to deliver antenatal care in Papua New Guinea? Results from a health system costing and budget impact analysis using cross-sectional data,BMJ Open,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: In Papua New Guinea (PNG), antenatal clinic attendance averaged 50% for one or more visits, and 30% for four visits in the last decade. In 2016, the WHO revised its focused antenatal care (ANC) model recommending eight rather than four visits. If implemented, this new model would require additional resources. This study estimated provider costs of ANC in PNG, including the expected cost of scaling up to universal ANC coverage as well as recommending eight visits. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional estimation of ANC costs collected from nine health facilities, which were part of a cluster randomised trial. Costs were estimated using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. The cost of the first and follow-up visits were estimated per woman, at the health facility level. Health system and scale-up costs of four visits were calculated by multiplying the aggregate cost of four visits by ANC utilisation rates. A budget impact analysis estimated the expected costs of delivering eight visits over 5 years. Univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted. Discounted costs are reported in local currency and 2019 international dollars using purchasing power parity data. RESULTS: The average cost of the first and follow-up visits were $17.66-$30.58 (K42.94-K74.34) in Madang and $11.26-$35.61 (K27.37-K86.56) in East New Britain. Four visits per woman cost $70.65-$122.33 (K171.76-K297.36) in Madang and $45.02-$142.45 (K109.50-K346.4) in East New Britain; and salaries represented the largest share of costs. The annual health system cost was $6.9 million (K16.9 million), the expected cost of scaling up to the universal coverage of four visits was $22.7 million (K55.2 million), and $45.4 million (K110.3 million) over 5 years for eight visits. CONCLUSION: Costs varied with the number of clinicians, infrastructure and ANC coverage, suggesting scaling up requires increasing the financial investment in ANC services. These results provide a template to strengthen health systems by improving the quality of care.",bim

The Propeller platform is a digital self-management tool that facilitates passive monitoring of inhaler medication utilization, potentially assisting the healthcare team to identify patients at risk of a COPD exacerbation who may require further intervention. This study estimated the budget impact of Propeller from commercial payer and Medicare fee-for-service payer perspectives. METHODS: An Excel-based model was used to estimate the budget impact of Propeller for COPD patients in commercial and Medicare population sizes of 5 million members. Data on prevalence, baseline healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and baseline use of rescue and controller inhaler medications with unit costs (adjusted to 2020 US dollars) were obtained from peer-reviewed literature. Data on reductions in HCRU during Propeller usage were based on direct evidence. Estimates for costs of remote monitoring were obtained from publicly available information. All patients were assumed to have insurance claims related to ongoing remote monitoring. RESULTS: The estimated number of annual eligible COPD patients for commercial and Medicare was 212,200 and 606,600, respectively. Propeller decreased costs by an estimated $2,475 (commercial) and $915 (Medicare) per enrolled patient. The greatest increase in expenditure was for remote monitoring related expenses. After accounting for estimated reductions in hospitalizations, emergency department visits and short-acting beta-agonist use, total net savings were approximately $1.60 and $1.70 per-member per-month for commercial and Medicare payers, respectively. CONCLUSION: Propeller is projected to be cost saving from both the commercial and Medicare payer perspectives.",bim

9910243,Mallick R,A Budget Impact Model of Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy with IgPro20 (Hizentra) Relative to Intravenous Immunoglobulin in the United States,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, progressive autoimmune disease causing peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Guidelines recommend immunoglobulin (IG) therapy as an immunomodulatory agent in CIDP. Drawbacks and unmet needs with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) include adverse effects and wear-off effects, along with the burden of administration based on site of care. Subcutaneous administration of Hizentra, a subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) reduces patient burden by allowing self-administration outside the hospital setting and has fewer adverse events (AEs). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the expected cost of treatment and the budget impact of Hizentra compared with IVIG for maintenance treatment of CIDP in the United States. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to estimate the expected budget impact of maintenance treatment with Hizentra for US stakeholders. The model adopts primarily a US integrated delivery network perspective and, secondarily, a commercial perspective over a 1-year time horizon. Pharmacy costs were based on a payment mix of average sales price (73%), wholesale acquisition cost (2%), and average wholesale price (25%). Costs in the model reflect 2022 US dollars. In accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines and recommendations for budget impact modeling, no discounting was performed. The PATH clinical study of Hizentra maintenance in CIDP was used to determine clinical inputs for relapse rates at initial assessment (24 weeks) and at 52 weeks for Hizentra. The ICE clinical study of Gamunex maintenance in CIDP was the basis of relapse rates for Gamunex (and other IVIGs). Literature-based estimates were obtained for infusion costs by site of care, costs of IVIG infusion-related complications, and significant IVIG AE rates. Hizentra AE rates from the US Hizentra prescribing information were assessed but were not included in the model as the AEs in CIDP were mild, easily treated, and self-limited. Sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate variations from the base case. RESULTS: The model showed that a Hizentra starting dose of 0.2 g/kg is expected to result in annual cost savings of US$32,447 per patient compared with IVIG. For a hypothetical 25-million-member plan, the budget impact of a 10% market share shift from IVIG to Hizentra is expected to result in savings of US$2,296,235. CONCLUSION: This analysis projects that Hizentra is likely associated with favorable economic benefit compared with IVIG in managing CIDP.",bim

DESIGN: This is a retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study has been held at the Department of Gynaecology, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin. POPULATION: This included all women who underwent outpatient flexible cystoscopy in Rotunda Hospital between May 2023 to October 2024. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data collection included patient demographics, indications for referrals, cystoscopic findings, post-procedural complications, and cost-benefit analysis. RESULTS: A total of 77 women underwent flexible cystoscopy. The mean age was 52.5 years ranging from 20 to 85 years. Flexible cystoscopy was successfully completed in all patients, and there were no post procedure complications. The most common indications were as follows: recurrent urinary tract infections (36%) and bladder pain syndrome (36%), followed by overactive bladder symptoms (14%). Fifty-five percent of patients had no abnormal findings. The most common abnormality found was trabeculations (39%), followed by glomerulations (9%). A cost-benefit analysis showed an approximate saving of € 1211 per patient leading to a saving of over € 93,000 over a period of 18 months. CONCLUSION: Outpatient cystoscopy is a low-risk, feasible, well tolerated, and safe diagnostic procedure, with no post-procedure complications observed in this study. It avoids the risks of general anaesthesia and is associated with lower procedural costs.",cem
12030236,Du Z,Recent Progress in Cellulose-Based Conductive Hydrogels,Polymers (Basel),2025,"- Cellulose, a widely abundant natural polymer, is well recognized for its remarkable properties, such as biocompatibility, degradability, and mechanical strength. Conductive hydrogels, with their unique ability to conduct electricity, have attracted significant attention in various fields. The combination of cellulose and conductive hydrogels has led to the emergence of cellulose-based conductive hydrogels, which show great potential in flexible electronics, biomedicine, and energy storage. This review article comprehensively presents the latest progress in cellulose-based conductive hydrogels. Firstly, it provides an in-depth overview of cellulose, covering aspects like its structure, diverse sources, and classification. This emphasizes cellulose's role as a renewable and versatile material. The development and applications of different forms of cellulose, including delignified wood, bacterial cellulose, nanocellulose, and modified cellulose, are elaborated. Subsequently, cellulose-based hydrogels are introduced, with a focus on their network structures, such as single-network, interpenetrating network, and semi-interpenetrating network. The construction of cellulose-based conductive hydrogels is then discussed in detail. This includes their conductive forms, which are classified into electronic and ionic conductive hydrogels, and key performance requirements, such as cost-effectiveness, mechanical property regulation, sensitive response to environmental stimuli, self-healing ability, stable conductivity, and multifunctionality. The applications of cellulose-based conductive hydrogels in multiple areas are also presented. In wearable sensors, they can effectively monitor human physiological signals in real time. In intelligent biomedicine, they contribute to wound healing, tissue engineering, and nerve regeneration. In flexible supercapacitors, they offer potential for green and sustainable energy storage. In gel electrolytes for conventional batteries, they help address critical issues like lithium dendrite growth. Despite the significant progress, there are still challenges to overcome. These include enhancing the multifunctionality and intelligence of cellulose-based conductive hydrogels, strengthening their connection with artificial intelligence, and achieving simple, green, and intelligent large-scale industrial production. Future research directions should center around exploring new synthesis methods, optimizing material properties, and expanding applications in emerging fields, aiming to promote the widespread commercialization of these materials.",cem
12014790,Alansari AN,Telemedicine applications in pediatric emergency surgery and trauma: a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy and clinical effectiveness,Pediatr Surg Int,2025,"- AIM: This review examines the effectiveness, implementation factors, and outcomes of telemedicine applications in managing surgical emergencies and trauma in pediatric patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed across four major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) from inception to January 2025. Studies that investigate telemedicine interventions in pediatric (ages 0-18) emergency surgery and trauma settings were included. RESULTS: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 6 retrospective cohorts, 3 cross-sectional studies, 1 prospective cohort, and 1 case series. Diagnostic accuracy was consistently high across applications (sensitivity: 93.8-100%; specificity: 82.6-99.7%). Telemedicine demonstrated effectiveness in preventing unnecessary transfers, with one study reporting 16 prevented transfers. Remote-guided procedures showed comparable accuracy to in-person assessment, particularly in point-of-care ultrasound (sensitivity: 93.8%, specificity: 99.7%). High satisfaction rates were reported among families and healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the potential of telemedicine in pediatric emergency surgery and trauma care, particularly in enhancing access to specialized care and maintaining diagnostic accuracy. However, the generalizability of findings remains limited due to variations in study methodologies. Future research should emphasize prospective designs and economic evaluations to clarify the cost-benefit ratio of implementation. Establishing standardized protocols and enhancing provider training will be essential for the effective and sustainable integration of telemedicine into pediatric trauma systems.",cem
12011068,Takamoto N,Cost‐effectiveness analysis of 9‐valent human papillomavirus vaccine combined with screening for cervical cancer in Japan,Int J Gynaecol Obstet,2024,"- OBJECTIVE: In Japan, the current coverage rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is only 30%, and the rate of biennial cervical screening is 40%. The Japanese Government has attempted to increase the coverage of HPV vaccination and cervical screening. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent HPV vaccine and cervical screening in Japan. METHODS: A yearly cycle Markov model with 15 health states was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 9-valent HPV vaccination and cervical screening in women aged 12-75 years. We considered four scenarios: 30% coverage of vaccination with 40% coverage of biennial screening (Scenario 1 representing the current Japanese situation), 70% (the highest proportion in 2013 in Japan) and 90% coverage of vaccination with 40% coverage of biennial screening (Scenarios 2 and 3, respectively), and 90% coverage of vaccination with 70% coverage of biennial screening (Scenarios 4). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on the perspective of the healthcare payer and compared with the benchmark for willingness to pay in Japan (41 700 USD per QALY). The cumulative morbidity and mortality in each scenario were analyzed using the Markov model. RESULTS: Compared with Scenario 1, the ICERs of Scenarios 2, 3, and 4 were 5382, 5321, and 8524 USD/QALY, respectively, which were lower than the benchmark for willingness to pay. As the coverage of HPV vaccination and cervical screening increased, the cumulative morbidity and mortality decreased. CONCLUSION: Increasing the coverage of the 9-valent HPV vaccination and cervical screening is cost-effective in Japan.",cem
12023660,Locke J,Study protocol for testing the efficacy of the Helping Educational Leaders Mobilize Evidence (HELM) implementation strategy in elementary schools: a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial,Implement Sci,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Schools need to implement universal student supports that prevent social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties; minimize associated risks; and promote social, emotional, and behavioral competencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the Helping Educational Leaders Mobilize Evidence (HELM) implementation strategy for promoting school-level implementation leadership, implementation climate, and high-fidelity delivery of an evidence-based practice. We will test HELM with an exemplar EBP, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS). The specific aims of the study are to: 1) experimentally evaluate the effects of HELM versus PBIS training and technical assistance only (control condition); and 2) explore for whom, under what conditions, how equitably, and through which processes HELM works to improve outcomes, as well as its cost-effectiveness. METHODS: This study will use a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to provide a rigorous test of the effects of HELM in elementary schools. Schools will be randomly assigned to HELM + PBIS training and technical assistance (n = 21 schools; n = 210 educators) or PBIS training and technical assistance only (n = 21 schools; n = 210 educators) in a 1:1 ratio within cohorts using covariate constrained randomization that accounts for degree of prior PBIS exposure (measured using the Tiered Fidelity Inventory at baseline) and school size. A series of mixed effects models (time within educator, educator within school) will test within-subject/between-subject interactions across three timepoints (12 months total) to examine whether HELM will show steeper gains than the control on implementation leadership (primary outcome), implementation climate, PBIS fidelity, and student outcomes. Mediational analyses will test hypothesized mechanisms of change (i.e., implementation leadership and climate) of HELM on PBIS fidelity. Sequential mixed-methods data collection and analyses will further explore how organizational mechanisms are linked to implementation outcomes. Cost-effectiveness analyses will compare costs and outcomes of PBIS training and technical assistance only versus PBIS implementation with HELM. DISCUSSION: The nature of leadership support in schools can make the difference between successful and unsuccessful EBP implementation. Testing HELM within the context of PBIS implementation will provide rigorous evidence about whether and how HELM can equitably address important EBP and student outcomes.

12015011,Abdali Z,Cost-effectiveness of digoxin versus beta blockers in permanent atrial fibrillation: the Rate Control Therapy Evaluation in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) randomised trial,Heart,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major and increasing burden on health services. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of digoxin versus beta-blockers for heart rate control in patients with permanent AF and symptoms of heart failure. METHODS: RAte control Therapy Evaluation in permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) was a randomised, open-label, blinded, endpoint trial embedded in the UK National Health Service (NHS) to directly compare low-dose digoxin with beta-blockers (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02391337). A trial-based cost-utility analysis was performed from a healthcare perspective over 12 months. Resource use in primary and secondary healthcare services, medications and patient-reported quality of life were prospectively collected to estimate differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: RATE-AF randomised 160 patients with mean age of 76 (SD 8) years and 46% women, of which 149 patients (n=73 digoxin, n=76 beta blockers) had complete data and survived to 12-month follow-up. Treatment with digoxin was significantly less costly, with a mean saving of £530.41 per patient per year (95% CI -£848.06 to -£249.38, p=0.001). This was principally due to substantially lower rates of adverse events, with less primary and secondary healthcare utilisation compared with beta-blocker therapy. There was no significant difference in QALYs (0.013; 95% CI -0.033 to 0.052, p=0.56). At the £20 000 per-QALY willingness to pay threshold, the probability of digoxin being cost-effective compared with beta-blockers was 94%, with potential annual savings to the NHS of £102 million/year (95% CI £48 million to £164 million saving, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Digoxin is a less costly option when compared with beta-blockers for control of heart rate in suitable patients with permanent AF, with larger cost-effectiveness studies warranted to advise on national and global policy-making.

12032712,Yang J,INSTIs-centered antiviral regimens for first-line treatment of HIV/AIDS: a network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis,BMC Infect Dis,2025,"- OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of INSTI-based antiretroviral regimens compared to the national standard first-line treatment EFV/3TC/TDF for HIV/AIDS in China. The aim is to guide clinical decision-making and improve HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. METHODS: A network meta-analysis was conducted using ADDIS software on data from domestic and international randomized controlled trials comparing INSTI-based regimens with EFV/3 TC/TDF. Additionally, a Markov model assessed the cost-effectiveness of the representative INSTI regimen B/F/TAF (Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide) against EFV/3 TC/TDF. Costs and health outcomes were measured in US Dollars ($) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), respectively, evaluating incremental cost-utility ratios (ICERs) against a willingness-to-pay threshold of 1.5 times GDP per capita. RESULTS: Seventeen trials involving 12,620 patients were analyzed. INSTI regimens showed no significant efficacy or safety advantages over EFV/3 TC/TDF but offered better drug resistance, adherence, and quality of life improvements. Economic analysis from the patient perspective showed that B/F/TAF had an ICER of $12,714.29/QALY, which is below the willingness-to-pay threshold, indicating cost-effectiveness. From the healthcare system perspective, B/F/TAF's ICER was $23,052.77/QALY, which is above the threshold, suggesting it is not cost-effective from this perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings, with drug costs for B/F/TAF and the probability of CD4 count increase post-EFV/3TC/TDF treatment being the largest influencing factors. Additionally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that B/F/TAF has a varying probability of economic viability depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold, highlighting its potential value in specific economic contexts. CONCLUSION: INSTI-based regimens are as effective and safe as the national standard but offer additional benefits in drug resistance and patient compliance. B/F/TAF is economically viable from the patient perspective but does not present a cost-utility advantage from the healthcare system perspective. This study underscores the need for considering both clinical and economic factors in selecting first-line HIV/AIDS treatments in China.",cem
12039489,Malone DC,An evaluation of vilobelimab (anti-C5a) as a cost-effective option to treat severely ill mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19,Am J Health Syst Pharm,2024,"- PURPOSE: COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) have few available treatment options. PANAMO, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of vilobelimab, which blocks the inflammatory process caused by complement component 5a, demonstrated a significant mortality benefit at 28 and 60 days in these patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vilobelimab plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone. The model simulated progression from severe COVID-19 to survival or death over a lifetime horizon. Outcomes data (COVID-19 all-cause mortality and renal replacement therapy) were incorporated from the PANAMO trial. COVID-19 mortality estimates were based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention age-specific survival data. Utility values and hospital costs came from the literature. Vilobelimab cost was obtained from RED BOOK Online. RESULTS: For COVID-19 ICU patients, total costs of care were $103,414 (SOC) and $132,247 (SOC plus vilobelimab), respectively, resulting in an incremental cost of $28,833. SOC provided 6.70 QALYs versus 7.99 QALYs for vilobelimab, an additional 1.29 QALYs. The ICER for vilobelimab plus SOC versus SOC alone was $22,287/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the cost-effectiveness result as vilobelimab plus SOC was favored at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 in over 81% of iterations. CONCLUSION: Vilobelimab provides a cost-effective option to treat ICU patients with severe COVID-19 receiving IMV compared to SOC, at well below the commonly accepted $50,000 US willingness-to-pay threshold.",cem
12047453,Agathangelou G,Economic Evaluation of Population-Level Chronic Kidney Disease Interventions in the UK National Health Service,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2025,"- Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 13% of the global population, is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of premature death by 2040, and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and acute cardiovascular events. With an aging population and rising diabetes rates, the prevalence of CKD is expected to escalate in the United Kingdom, leading to substantial healthcare costs. When patients reach end-stage kidney disease, interventions such as dialysis and transplantation are required. Dialysis is not only extremely costly but is also associated with a diminished quality of life and significantly elevated mortality. Objectives: This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of several population-level interventions designed to manage CKD, including its progression to end-stage kidney disease. Methods: A population-level Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and population health impacts of 4 key interventions, individually and combined: (1) early/improved diagnosis, (2) enhanced CKD management, (3) increased use of SGLT-2 inhibitors, and (4) higher rates of pre-emptive live donor transplantation. The model incorporates both NHS direct costs and broader economic impacts, with a 10-year horizon and quarterly cycles. Two scenarios were analyzed: a base case (based on disease progression probabilities) and a constrained case (where growth in the number of patients receiving dialysis and transplantation is limited to historical rates observed in the UK National Health Service). Results: All interventions demonstrated cost-effectiveness, with the combined approach preventing 10 351 deaths and yielding 48 381 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost of £7675 per QALY in the base case scenario. In the constrained scenario, the combined interventions demonstrated cost-effectiveness, preventing 10 026 deaths and yielding 47 514 QALYs at a cost of £22 767 per QALY. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of population level interventions for management of CKD, and the significant burden of dialysis, with avoidance of progression to dialysis a key driver of QALY gains and cost offsets.",cem
12021152,Allen CL,"The cost-effectiveness of interventions used for the screening, diagnosis and management of anaemia in pregnancy: A systematic review",PLOS Glob Public Health,2025,"- An estimated 40% of pregnant women worldwide are anaemic, of which 80% live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The reality of finite health budgets, particularly in low-resource settings, means that interventions used for screening, diagnosing, and treating anaemia in pregnancy need to be informed by cost-effectiveness evidence. We conducted a systematic review to identify all studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of managing anaemia in pregnancy. We searched two health economics (NHS EED and EconLit) and four medical (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus and CENTRAL) databases for relevant studies published up to the 9th of August 2024. Studies were eligible if they conducted an economic evaluation of any intervention used in the management of anaemia in pregnancy regardless of aetiology, provided that anaemia was a specified outcome. Data were extracted and study quality assessed by two independent reviewers using the extended CHEC-E tool. Due to significant heterogeneity, data were analysed narratively. 19 eligible cost-effectiveness studies were identified. Nine studies related to iron deficiency anaemia, finding that intravenous rather than oral iron supplements were cost-effective in most instances. Multiple micronutrient supplements were also found to be cost-effective compared to iron and folic acid supplements. Ten studies related to malaria-related anaemia, identifying several cost-effective antimalarial regimens; both preventative and therapeutic. Cost-effective delivery channels of antimalarials as well as non-pharmacological interventions were also identified. This review identifies several avenues through which the management of anaemia in pregnancy can be optimised from an economic perspective. Despite this, there is a significant deficit of cost-effectiveness evidence relating to this condition, which limited the deduction of cost-effectiveness for many of the interventions assessed.",cem
12015888,Cooper N,The Cost-Effectiveness of Avatrombopag Versus Eltrombopag and Romiplostim in the Treatment of Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia in the UK,J Mark Access Health Policy,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Thrombopoietin receptor agonists-romiplostim, eltrombopag and avatrombopag-are commonly used as second-line treatments for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of the three TPO-RAs in adults with insufficient response to previous treatment from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). The model considered the effects of bleeding events, concomitant ITP medications, rescue therapies and treatment related adverse events over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs for effectiveness were based on a network meta-analysis and other published literature on ITP management. Other model inputs included costs (e.g., drug acquisition and administration) and healthcare resource utilisation. RESULTS: Avatrombopag was associated with higher quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (10.979) than romiplostim (10.628) and eltrombopag (10.085), producing incremental QALYs of -0.351 and -0.894, respectively. Avatrombopag was associated with lower total costs (GBP £319,334) compared with romiplostim (GBP 406,361 [cost saving of GBP 87,027]) and higher total costs compared with eltrombopag (GBP 313,987 [incremental cost of GBP 5347]). Avatrombopag therefore dominated romiplostim (more effective and less expensive) and was cost-effective versus eltrombopag (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 5982 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Avatrombopag is a cost-effective treatment compared with romiplostim and eltrombopag for the second-line treatment of adults with ITP from the perspective of the UK NHS.",cem
12020752,Jiang C,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer: perspectives from US and Chinese payers,BMJ Open,2025,"- BACKGROUND: The KEYNOTE-966 study demonstrated that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). However, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the USA and China remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy from the perspective of US and Chinese payers. DESIGN: Markov models with three health states were developed to simulate the process of advanced BTC. Cost data were obtained from available databases and published literature in the US scenario, and from local institutions from the China scenario. Utility values were derived from previous studies. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In the US scenario, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy increased costs by US$97,222.13, compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of US$810 184.42 per QALY. In the China scenario, the ICER was $360 933.50 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicated the costs of pembrolizumab had the greatest impact on the model in both scenarios. Further analyses suggested that the optimal price of pembrolizumab in the USA would be nearly US$10.33 /mg, while a price reduction of over 90% would be required for the combined therapy to be cost-effective for patients in China. CONCLUSION: Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold set at three times the gross domestic product per capita, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not a cost-effective option for patients with advanced BTC in either the USA or China. Significant price reduction for pembrolizumab may be necessary to achieve an acceptable ICER. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04003636; postresults.",cem

12012355,Lowin J,Cost-effectiveness of trans-abdominal ultrasound for gallbladder cancer surveillance in patients with gallbladder polyps less than 10 mm in the United Kingdom,Br J Radiol,2025,"- OBJECTIVES: Gallbladder polyps (GBPs) are commonly detected with trans-abdominal ultrasound (TAUS). Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is associated with GBPs but the risk of malignancy is low. International guidelines recommend ultrasound surveillance (USS) in selected cases of GBPs <10 mm, with cholecystectomy advised if the polyp size increases. USS (including potential cholecystectomies) is resource intense. We evaluated the costs and potential cost-effectiveness of USS in a theoretical UK patient cohort with GBPs. METHODS: A health economic model mapped expected management pathways over 2 years for 1000 GBP patients with and without USS, stratified by the initial size of GBP (<6 mm and 6-9 mm). We estimated USS resource and costs under alternate referral thresholds for cholecystectomy. Clinical data were extracted from a large-scale cohort study. TAUS and cholecystectomy costs were based on NHS tariffs. GBC costs were estimated from the literature. Outcomes included USS costs, expected numbers of GBC, and incremental cost for each case of GBC avoided. RESULTS: The 2-year additional cohort costs of USS (n = number of cholecystectomies) were estimated between £213 441 (n = 50) and £750 045 (n = 253) in GBPs <6 mm and between £420 275 (n = 165) and £531 297 (n = 207) in GBPs 6-9 mm, balanced against avoidance of 1.3 (<6 mm) and 8.7 (6-9 mm) cases of GBC. Model findings were robust to plausible changes in inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Using published data, we demonstrated that, in patients with GBPs <10 mm, the costs of USS to avoid GBC outweigh potential GBC cost offsets and would result in high rates of cholecystectomy. Additional evidence is needed to establish the formal cost-effectiveness of GBP USS in the UK. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: • We developed a health economic model, based on published data, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guideline-recommended ultrasound surveillance (USS) in patients with gallbladder polyps measuring less than 10 mm in the UK.• The analysis provides a transparent platform to explore potential numbers of trans-abdominal ultrasound studies and cholecystectomies that might be expected if USS protocols are adhered to and discovers important gaps in current evidence that could be filled by additional targeted research.",cem
12013952,Ononge S,Cost-effectiveness results comparing heat-stable carbetocin & other uterotonics in postpartum heamorrhage prevention in Uganda,PLOS Glob Public Health,2025,"- In Uganda, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for 34% of all institutional maternal deaths. Injectable oxytocin is the preferred uterotonic for prevention of PPH. However, in resource-limited settings, the effectiveness of oxytocin is sub-optimal due to efficacy, quality (cold chain storage requirements), and manufacturing standards (poor quality active pharmaceutical ingredients, lack of sterile manufacturing environment, and low-quality manufacturing processes). This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of heat-stable carbetocin, a quality uterotonic newly recommended by WHO and Ugandan Ministry of Health, compared to standard uterotonics for the prevention of PPH in Uganda. A decision tree model was built to assess the cost-effectiveness of heat-stable carbetocin compared to the current standards of care - oxytocin, misoprostol or oxytocoin+misoprostol combination. The model was applied to a hypothetical annual cohort of birthing women eligible for PPH prevention in Uganda's public health facilities. The evaluation considered direct costs and health outcomes using a public health perspective. The model inputs were obtained through literature review and, whenever referencable information was unavailable or incomplete, from key opinion leaders. Compared to oxytocin, administering heat-stable carbetocin to prevent PPH had a cascading favorable effect and was estimated to avert 57,536 PPH cases, 123 maternal deaths, and 4,203 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Heat-stable carbetocin is also cost-saving where the direct cost to the public healthcare system was lower by USD $1,058,353 (UGX 3,998,350,875). The benefits of heat-stable carbetocin were even greater when compared with misoprostol (averted 73,939 PPH events, 273 maternal deaths, and 8,716 DALYs, and lowered public healthcare system costs by USD $2,118,372 [UGX 8,002,996,052]). Heat-stable carbetocin for preventing PPH in Uganda has the potential to reduce PPH events, and subsequently maternal deaths, DALYs, and costs for the public healthcare system. Adopting heat-stable carbetocin will contribute towards achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 3.1.",cem
12037958,Otten LS,Very Early Health Technology Assessment for Potential Predictive Biomarkers in the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,Pharmacoecon Open,2025,"- OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing treatment is currently prescribed as first-line treatment for all patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver mutations. However, only 30-45% of patients show no progression within 12 months after treatment start. Various biomarkers are being studied to save costly and potentially harmful treatment in non-responders. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of implementing a hypothetical predictive biomarker for ICI-containing treatment response compared with standard of care (e.g., no implemented biomarker) for pembrolizumab-containing treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard-of-care-based and predictive-biomarker-based strategies were compared using Markov models for three first-line pembrolizumab-containing treatments depending on a patient's tumor programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and histology. A Dutch healthcare system perspective was adopted. Assuming a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve of 1.0 in identifying responders, alternative treatments were offered for non-responders in the predictive-biomarker-based strategy. Parameters and assumptions were based on real-world data from surveys, literature using a targeted search, expert opinion, and registries. Outcomes included differences in costs, survival (life years (LYs)), and survival corrected for health-related quality of life (QoL) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the predictive-biomarker- and standard-of-care-based strategy. RESULTS: Implementing a predictive biomarker in pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment led to a mean survival reduction of 24 days (- 0.067 LYs) (18 days corrected for QoL (- 0.049 QALYs)), with cost savings of €22,606 compared with standard of care. Pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab-pemetrexed-platinum treatments showed survival reductions of 4.5 and 3.9 months, respectively (3.6 and 2.8 months corrected for QoL), with cost savings of €24,345 and €28,456. Sensitivity analyses confirmed consistent cost savings and survival reductions. Survival losses were mainly observed due to the lower survival rates associated with the alternative first-line treatment options available for non-responders in the predictive-biomarker-based strategy within each pembrolizumab-containing treatment regimen. Pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment also showed survival gains under certain conditions related to QoL and survival estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of careful de-implementation of ICI-treatments in advanced NSCLC, balancing costs reductions and side effects without comprising survival. In the pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment regimen, the survival loss could be considered negligible. Future research should define acceptable tradeoffs and thresholds for de-implementation, considering factors such as survival of alternative treatments and responder classification to guide predictive biomarker implementation and optimize health resource allocation.",cem
12021199,Mvundura M,"Cost-effectiveness of wastewater-based environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in Blantyre, Malawi and Kathmandu, Nepal: A model-based study",PLOS Glob Public Health,2025,"- Wastewater-based environmental surveillance (ES) has been demonstrated to provide an early warning signal to predict variant-driven waves of pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of ES for SARS-CoV-2 compared with clinical testing alone. We used the Covasim agent-based model of COVID-19 to simulate disease transmission for hypothetical populations in Blantyre, Malawi, and Kathmandu, Nepal. We simulated the introduction of a new immune-escaping variant over 6 months and estimated health outcomes (cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) and economic impact when using ES to trigger a moderate proactive behavioral intervention (e.g., increased use of masks, social distancing) by policymakers versus no ES and hence a delayed reactive intervention. Costs considered included for ES, clinical testing, treatment, and productivity loss for the entire population due to implementation of the behavioral intervention. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and compared these with local willingness-to-pay thresholds: $61 for Malawi and $249 for Nepal. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of key assumptions on the results. Costs are reported in 2022 US dollars. We estimate that if ES were implemented, approximately 600 DALYs would be averted in Blantyre and approximately 300 DALYs averted in Kathmandu, over the six-month period. Considering health system costs, ES was cost-effective in Blantyre and cost-saving in Kathmandu. Cost-effectiveness of ES was highest in settings with low clinical surveillance, high disease severity, and high intervention effectiveness. However, from the societal perspective, ES may not be cost-effective depending on the magnitude of population-wide productivity losses associated with the proactive behavioral intervention and the cost-effectiveness threshold. SARS-CoV-2 ES has the potential to be a cost-saving or cost-effective tool from the health system perspective when linked to an effective public health response. From the societal perspective, however, the length of the behavioral intervention and its consequences for productivity losses of the entire population may make ES not cost-effective. Implementing ES for multiple pathogens may improve its cost-effectiveness.",cem
12040845,Feng W,Health economic evaluation of newborn hepatitis B immunization prevention strategies in Ningbo: a Markov modeling study,Front Public Health,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection poses a significant public health challenge in China. The Prevention of mother-to-child Transmission (PMTCT) strategy of combining universal hepatitis B vaccination with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) for newborns is crucial in preventing widespread infection. In this study, we conduct health economic evaluation of three strategies: PMTCT, universal vaccination, and non-vaccination for newborns in Ningbo, China. METHODS: This study developed a decision-Markov model and simulated a cohort of 100,000 newborns to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of three strategies from a healthcare system perspective. The primary outputs included total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), benefit-cost ratios (BCRs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to verify the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Among the three strategies, the PMTCT results in the least disease burden and mortality related to hepatitis B. In comparison to a cohort of 100,000 unvaccinated infants, the PMTCT is expected to prevent 6,029 cases of acute symptomatic infections, 27,348 HBV carriers, 4,170 chronic infections, 3,597 cases of cirrhosis, 2,911 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 3,930 HBV-related deaths. The ICERs for PMTCT and universal vaccination were - 56,371.77 yuan/QALY and - 56,654.77 yuan/QALY, respectively. The BCRs for PMTCT and universal vaccination were 19.13 and 15.95, respectively, when compared to no vaccination. The PSA revealed that all ICER scatter points are situated within the fourth quadrant, and the probability of PMTCT being cost-effective exceeds 90%. CONCLUSION: Implementing universal hepatitis B vaccination with HBIG for newborns in Ningbo demonstrated high cost-effectiveness, making the continuation of the PMTCT strategy highly recommended.",cem
12020218,Zhang T,Cost-effectiveness of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease population screening in China: based on individual data from WHO Collaborating Centre-initiated ‘Enjoying Breathing Program’,BMC Public Health,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) imposes a significant and growing burden on China and the world. Early detection and diagnosis may be an effective way to alleviate this severe pressure on public health. The Enjoying Breathing Program (the Program), a nationwide one-time and two-step COPD screening and management program with long-term follow-up initiated by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre (WHO CC), has demonstrated its significant clinical benefit. However, the cost-effectiveness of the Program remains unknown. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of the Program of COPD screening to no screening from a Chinese healthcare perspective. Patient-level data, including treatment rate, medication cost, transition probability, etc., were sourced from the Program. Other parameter data were sourced from published literature. RESULTS: Enjoying Breathing Program for COPD screening was proved probably cost-effective compared with no screening in China with an incremental cost of $118, and incremental health benefit gain of 0.021 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $5,679/QALY which was much less than willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 1×Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 2022 ($11,814). Sensitivity analysis proved the robustness of the results and subgroup analysis demonstrated health benefits varied among different subgroups. Annual screening and higher compliance may further enhance the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the underlying uncertainty, annual two-step COPD population screening in China may probably be cost-effective compared with no screening and deserves further large-scale implementation.",cem
12041463,Poprom N,Cost utility analysis of antibiotics compared with operative treatment in uncomplicated acute appendicitis,Sci Rep,2025,"- Appendicitis is the most common acute abdominal condition affecting general surgical practice. Recently, conservative treatment with antibiotics has been considered as an alternative. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate if antibiotics could be cost-effective compared to laparoscopic appendectomy or open appendectomy. A prospective study was undertaken to estimate health-related quality of life for antibiotic and operative treatment, and to ascertain costs in a cohort. A societal perspective incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at 1 year after surgery was estimated. A probabilistic sensitivity analyses was performed. ICERs were estimated comparisons between individual antibiotics, laparoscopic appendectomy, and open appendectomy in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Antibiotics showed improved cost savings compared to operative treatments with an ICER of -113,973.09 USD per quality adjusted life year at 1 year. Based on one year findings, antibiotics represent a lower cost treatment option with better cost-utility compared to operative treatment options in uncomplicated acute appendicitis patients. As such, antibiotic treatment can be initially considered as an alternative option where resources are limited to minimize complication rates associated with operative treatments.",cem
6262601,Dranitsaris G,Low-molecular-weight heparins for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer: A systematic literature review of efficacy and cost-effectiveness,J Oncol Pharm Pract,2017,"- BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer have an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism. Importantly, patients with cancer, who have metastatic disease, renal insufficiency, or are receiving anticancer therapy, have an even higher risk of a recurrent event. Similarly, the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism is higher than the risk of an initial event. To reduce the risk, extended duration of prophylaxis for up to six months with low-molecular-weight heparins such as dalteparin, enoxaparin, nadroparin, and tinzaparin is recommended by international guidelines. In this paper, the clinical and economic literature is reviewed to provide evidenced based recommendations based on clinical benefit and economic value. METHODS: A systematic review of major databases was conducted from January 1996 to October 2016 for randomized controlled trials evaluating the four distinct low-molecular-weight heparins against a vitamin K antagonists control group for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with active cancer. This was then followed by the application of the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidance to assess the quality of all trials that met the inclusion criteria. Finally, the cost-effectiveness literature supporting the value proposition of each product was reviewed. RESULTS: Six randomized trials met the inclusion criteria. There were one, two, and three trials that compared dalteparin, tinzaparin, and enoxaparin to a vitamin K antagonists control group. However, there were no trials for nadroparin in the setting of secondary venous thromboembolism prevention. In addition, only the dalteparin and one of the tinzaparin trials were of high quality and adequately powered. Of the two studies, only the dalteparin trial reported a statistically significant benefit in terms of venous thromboembolism absolute risk reduction when compared to a vitamin K antagonists control group (HR = 0.48; p = 0.002). In addition, there was robust pharmacoeconomic data from Canada, the Netherlands, France, and Austria supporting the cost-effectiveness of dalteparin for this indication. There were no such studies for any of the other agents. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of high-quality clinical and cost-effectiveness data supports the use of dalteparin over other low-molecular-weight heparins for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.",slr_cem
9540264,Yuasa A,Systematic Literature Review of the Use of Productivity Losses/Gains in Cost-Effectiveness Analyses of Immune-Mediated Disorders,Adv Ther,2022,"- INTRODUCTION: In light of the lack of an agreed international standard for how to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), including cost-utility analyses (CUAs) from a societal perspective, there is uncertainty regarding to what extent the inclusion of productivity losses/gains in economic evaluations can affect cost-effectiveness results and subsequently decisions on whether to recommend new health technologies. To investigate this, we conducted a systematic review of CEAs and CUAs of drug-based therapies for a set of chronic immune-mediated disorders to understand how cost elements and calculation methods related to productivity losses/gains are used, examine the impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of including productivity costs, and explore factors that affect the inclusion of productivity loss. METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE(®) In-process, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library) were searched from January 2010 to October 2020 by two independent reviewers for all CEAs and CUAs in adults with any of the following conditions: ankylosing spondylitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis. Relevant study data were extracted and evidence was synthesized for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Productivity cost elements including absenteeism, presenteeism, unemployment/early retirement, premature mortality and informal care were extracted, along with the method used to determine them. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the inclusion of productivity loss. RESULTS: Our searches identified 5016 records, culminating in 198 unique studies from 234 publications following screening. Most of the studies investigated rheumatoid arthritis (37.0%) or psoriasis (32.0%). The majority were CUAs, with some including both a CEA and a CUA (73.0%). Most studies used a payer perspective only (28.5%) or a societal perspective only (21.0%). Of the 49 studies incorporating productivity losses/gains, 42 reported the type of cost element used; all of these used patient absenteeism, either alone or in addition with other elements. Only 16 studies reported the method used to value productivity changes, of which eight used a human capital approach, four used a friction cost approach and four used both approaches. Twenty-eight of the 49 studies (57.1%) reported inclusion of productivity losses/gains as contributing to more favourable cost-effectiveness outcomes and ICERs, while 12 (24.5%) reported no substantial impact. On the basis of a multivariate analysis, rheumatoid arthritis as the target disease had a statistically significant association with the inclusion of productivity loss compared with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our review suggest that incorporating productivity cost elements may positively affect cost-effectiveness outcomes in evaluations of therapeutics for immune-mediated disorders. Our work highlights the continued need for clarity when reporting how CEAs and CUAs in this disease area are conducted, in order to better inform healthcare decision-making.",slr_cem
9490571,Song C,Systematic literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer,BMJ Open,2022,"- OBJECTIVES: Review and assess cost-effectiveness studies of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for localised prostate cancer compared with open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). DESIGN: Systematic review. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, International HTA database, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database and various HTA websites were searched (January 2005 to March 2021) to identify the eligible cost-effectiveness studies. PARTICIPANTS: Cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-minimization analyses examining RARP versus ORP or LRP were included in this systematic review. INTERVENTIONS: Different surgical approaches to treat localized prostate cancer: RARP compared with ORP and LRP. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A structured narrative synthesis was developed to summarize results of cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness results (eg, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]). Study quality was assessed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria Extended checklist. Application of medical device features were evaluated. RESULTS: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, 11 of which were cost-utility analyses. Higher quality-adjusted life-years and higher costs were observed with RARP compared with ORP or LRP in 11 studies (91%). Among four studies comparing RARP with LRP, three reported RARP was dominant or cost-effective. Among ten studies comparing RARP with ORP, RARP was more cost-effective in five, not cost-effective in two, and inconclusive in three studies. Studies with longer time horizons tended to report favorable cost-effectiveness results for RARP. Nine studies (75%) were rated of moderate or good quality. Recommended medical device features were addressed to varying degrees within the literature as follows: capital investment included in most studies, dynamic pricing considered in about half, and learning curve and incremental innovation were poorly addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite study heterogeneity, RARP was more costly and effective compared with ORP and LRP in most studies and likely to be more cost-effective, particularly over a multiple year or lifetime time horizon. Further cost-effectiveness analyses for RARP that more thoroughly consider medical device features and use an appropriate time horizon are needed.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using key search terms for the clinical, economic, and humanistic burden. Databases were searched from 2010 to 2022, with articles screened independently by 2 reviewers at abstract and full-text stage against pre-defined eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Seventy-one publications were identified that reported relevant clinical, humanistic, and economic data. Prevalence and incidence of EPI varied across identified studies; EPI appears to be especially prevalent as a comorbid condition in patients with cystic fibrosis. EPI has a large impact on QoL, with lower QoL scores in patients with EPI compared with those without EPI. The instruments used to assess QoL, however, were inconsistent across studies. Where reported, economic burden studies highlighted that patients with EPI have higher healthcare resource utilization compared with those without, with costs increasing with disease severity. CONCLUSION: This systematic literature review highlights that patients with EPI have higher treatment costs and lower QoL scores than patients without EPI. The prevalence of EPI as a comorbid condition is high, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis.",slr_cem
5125108,Pinyol C,A Systematic Literature Review on the Cost-Effectiveness of Apixaban for Stroke Prevention in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation,Cardiol Ther,2016,"- INTRODUCTION: Economic evaluations are becoming increasingly important due to limitations in economic resources, the expense of many new treatments, the need to allocate health spending as effectively as possible, and the need to inform decision makers. Based on the data from the apixaban studies (ARISTOTLE and AVERROES), several economic evaluations have been performed in various countries to demonstrate the efficacy of apixaban versus warfarin and aspirin or other new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for preventing stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review of published economic evaluations with apixaban in the indication of stroke prevention in patients with NVAF. METHODS: A search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Index Medicus Español was conducted in June 2015. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established. The main characteristics were recorded for all relevant articles after being reviewed. In addition, a weighted version of the Drummond's checklist was used to further assess the quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: After review, 26 cost-effectiveness analyses through Markov models were included; the identified economic evaluations represent different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds, discount rates, medical costs, and healthcare systems. Apixaban was compared with warfarin/acenocoumarol in 7 of them (27%), with warfarin/NOACs in 14 (54%), with aspirin in 2 (8%), and with warfarin/aspirin in 3 (11%). Models were conducted from Europe (69%), USA (23%), Australia (4%), and Latin America (4%). All models reported cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, 92% reported using a payer perspective, and 8% using a societal perspective; the median quality score of the selected studies was 89 (out of 119), with a range of 55-103. In models performed in Europe, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of apixaban versus warfarin ranged from €5607/QALY to €57,245/QALY, while ICERs versus aspirin ranged from being dominant to €7334/QALY. In models carried out in the USA, ICERs of apixaban versus warfarin ranged from being dominant to $93,063/QALY. CONCLUSION: Different cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that apixaban is a cost-effective therapeutic option according to the WTP thresholds used in countries where cost-effectiveness analyses, were performed.

11127739,Londoño Trujillo D,Cost-Effectiveness of the Prenatal Detection of Congenital Heart Diseases: A Systematic Literature Review,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,2024,"- Background: Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital condition worldwide, with a prevalence of 80 cases per 10 000 live births. In addition to perinatal morbidity and mortality, it entails long-term consequences such as multiple surgeries, prolonged hospitalizations, lifelong cardiac follow-up, reduced quality of life, risk of heart failure, and premature mortality in adulthood. This significant health and economic burden on healthcare systems and families highlights the relevance of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of methods for early detection of this condition. Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and analyze existing economic evaluations on prenatal detection of congenital heart diseases through ultrasound, focusing on the reported cost-effectiveness results and the methodological quality of the evaluated studies according to established criteria. Methods: An SLR of economic evaluations was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A quantitative synthesis of key methodological components of each economic evaluation was performed. The incremental medical costs, effectiveness measures, and cost-effectiveness ratios reported in each study were compiled and compared. The methodological quality was assessed according to compliance with the 24 CHEERS criteria. Results: We found 785 articles, of which only 7 met all inclusion criteria. Most were cost-effectiveness analyses, with the most common outcome being number of cases detected. Screening with only 4-chamber views interpreted by general practitioners or cardiologists were dominant strategies compared with screening with 4-chamber plus outflow views interpreted by a general practitioner. Fetal echocardiography was most effective but most expensive. Screening with 4-chamber and outflow view, followed by referral to a specialist, were recommended as the least expensive strategy per defect detected. On average, articles met 17 of the 24 CHEERS criteria. Discussion: While recent cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrated improved methodological quality, there was a lack of homogeneity due to differences in comparators and population subgroups analyzed. Despite this heterogeneity, fetal ultrasonography screening was consistently identified as a cost-effective strategy, with its cost-effectiveness heavily influenced by the expertise of the interpreting physician. Conclusion: Most studies recommend implementing obstetric ultrasonography screening, without routine fetal echocardiography, for detecting congenital heart diseases.",slr_cem
10085926,Bozzani FM,"Costs and Cost-Effectiveness of Biomedical, Non-Surgical HIV Prevention Interventions: A Systematic Literature Review",Pharmacoeconomics,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Considerable evidence on the costs and cost-effectiveness of biomedical, non-surgical interventions to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission has been generated over the last decade. This study aims to synthesize findings and identify remaining knowledge gaps to suggest future research priorities. METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in August 2020 using the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and EconLit databases to retrieve economic evaluations and costing studies of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), injectable long-acting PrEP, vaginal microbicide rings and gels, HIV vaccines and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Studies reporting costs from the provider or societal perspective were included in the analysis. Those reporting on behavioural methods of prevention, condoms and surgical approaches (voluntary medical male circumcision) were excluded. The quality of reporting of the included studies was assessed using published checklists. RESULTS: We identified 3007 citations, of which 87 studies were retained. Most were set in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; n = 53) and focused on the costs and/or cost-effectiveness of oral PrEP regimens (n = 70). Model-based economic evaluations were the most frequent study design; only two trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses and nine costing studies were found. Less than half of the studies provided practical details on how the intervention would be delivered by the health system, and only three of these, all in LMICs, explicitly focused on service integration and its implication for delivery costs. 'Real-world' programme delivery mechanisms and costs of intervention delivery were rarely considered. PrEP technologies were generally found to be cost-effective only when targeting high-risk subpopulations. Single-dose HIV vaccines are expected to be cost-effective for all groups despite substantial uncertainty around pricing. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of primary, detailed and updated cost data, including above-service level costs, from a variety of settings makes it difficult to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specific delivery modes at scale, or to evaluate strategies for services integration. Closing this evidence gap around real-world implementation is vital, not least because the strategies targeting high-risk groups that are recommended by PrEP models may incur substantially higher costs and be of limited practical feasibility in some settings.",slr_cem

9333258,Jahangiri R,Cost-effectiveness of fixed-dose combination pill (Polypill) in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: A systematic literature review,PLoS One,2022,"- BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality could be prevented via the population-based and cost-effective interventions. A fixed-dose combination treatment is known as the polypill for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD has come up in recent years. PURPOSE: In order to provide recommendations for future economic evaluations, this systematic review aimed to review and assess the quality of published evidence on the cost-effectiveness of polypill in primary and secondary prevention of CVD, to identify the key drivers that impact the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic review of literature, following the PRISMA guidelines, was undertaken in the electronic databases. Two researchers identified the relevant studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to quality assessment of included studies. ICERs value adjusted to 2020 United States Dollar using consumer price index (CPI) and purchasing power parity (PPP). Finally, data were summarized via a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: In total, 24 articles were identified based on the determined inclusion criteria. All studies met more than 50% of the CHEERS criteria. Adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios varied from 24$ to 31000$(2020 US dollar) among the studies. The polypill resulted in the improved adherence and quality of life, at a price equal to or lower than multiple monotherapies. This price is typically below the commonly accepted thresholds or cost saving in both, primary and secondary prevention of CVD. The main identified cost-effectiveness drivers were the polypill price, adherence, age, CVD risk, and drug combination. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found that the polypill seemed to be a cost-effective intervention in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, it is necessary to conduct more economic evaluation studies based on the long-term clinical trials with large populations. Also, studies should consider how the polypill interacts with other primary and secondary preventive strategies as a complementary health strategy.",slr_cem
7340703,Kask G,Cost-Effectiveness of Operative Versus Non-Operative Treatment for Clavicle Fracture: a Systematic Literature Review,Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med,2020,"- PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Operative and non-operative treatment of midshaft clavicle fractures seems to yield comparative functional results. Furthermore, it has been suggested that surgery is more expensive compared with non-operative treatment of clavicle fracture. Cost-effectiveness seems to be more important in trends of treatment decisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of clavicle fracture treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Seven publications were selected, and 5 studies showed that operative treatment is more expensive than non-operative treatment. The mean overall cost per person in discounted prices was 10,230 USD for operative and 7923 USD for non-operative treatment. The mean absence from work ranged 8-193 and 24-69 days for operative and non-operative treatment, respectively. Studies varied in methods of assessing the cost-effectiveness of treatment modalities. Based on this literature review, routine operative treatment seems to be more expensive. In some cases, operative treatment might be more cost-effective. In all studies, direct and indirect costs of health care were calculated, but a great heterogeneity exists in the sources of cost data between countries. The cost-effectiveness of the treatment of clavicle fracture depends strongly on the cost of operative treatment and length of absence from work. Cost-effectiveness analysis could be a routine in RCT studies in the future.",slr_cem
8639520,Luo Z,Budget Impact Analysis of Diabetes Drugs: A Systematic Literature Review,Front Public Health,2021,"- Background: Budget impact analysis (BIA) is an economic assessment that estimates the financial consequences of adopting a new intervention. BIA is used to make informed reimbursement decisions, as a supplement to cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). Objectives: We systematically reviewed BIA studies associated with anti-diabetic drugs and assessed the extent to which international BIA guidelines were followed in these studies. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Web of Science, Econlit, Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data knowledge Service platform from database inception to June 30, 2021. ISPOR good practice guidelines were used as a methodological standard for assessing BIAs. We extracted and compared the study characteristics outlined by the ISPOR BIA Task Force to evaluate the guideline compliance of the included BIA. Results: A total of eighteen studies on the BIA for anti-diabetic drugs were identified. More than half studies were from developed countries. Seventeen studies were based on model and one study was based on real-world data. Overall, analysis considered a payer perspective, reported potential budget impacts over 1-5 years. Assumptions were mainly made about target population size, market share uptake of new interventions, and scope of cost. The data used for analysis varied among studies and was rarely justified. Model validation and sensitivity analysis were lacking in the current BIA studies. Rebate analysis was conducted in a few studies to explore the price discount that was required for new interventions to demonstrate cost equivalence to comparators. Conclusion: Existing studies evaluating budget impact for anti-diabetic drugs vary greatly in methodology, some of which showed low compliance to good practice guidelines. In order for the BIA to be useful for assisting in health plan decision-making, it is important for future studies to optimize compliance to national or ISPOR good practice guidelines on BIA. Model validation and sensitivity analysis should also be improved in future BIA studies.

This study aimed to synthesize the economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of syphilis screening in pregnant women that might contribute to making recommendations on the future direction of syphilis screening approaches. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies published before 19 January 2023 and identified the cost-effectiveness analyses for syphilis screening in pregnant women. The methodological design quality was appraised by the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist. RESULTS: In total, 17 literature met the eligibility criteria for a full review. Of the 17 studies, four evaluated interventions using different screening methods, seven assessed a combination of syphilis testing and treatment interventions, three focused on repeat screening intervention, and four evaluated the interventions that integrated syphilis and HIV testing. The most cost-effective strategy appeared to be rapid syphilis testing with high treatment rates in pregnant women who were positive. DISCUSSION: The cost-effectiveness of syphilis screening for pregnancy has been widely demonstrated. It is very essential to improve the compliance with maternal screening and the treatment rates for positive pregnant women while implementing screening.",slr_cem
7713190,Woods JB,Clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of individual mental health workers colocated within primary care practices: a systematic literature review,BMJ Open,2020,"- OBJECTIVES: Mental health disorders contribute significantly to the global burden of disease and lead to extensive strain on health systems. The integration of mental health workers into primary care has been proposed as one possible solution, but evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness of this approach is unclear. We reviewed the clinical and cost effectiveness of mental health workers colocated within primary care practices. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES: We searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and Global Health databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All quantitative studies published before July 2019 were eligible for the review; participants of any age and gender were included. Studies did not need to report a certain outcome measure or comparator in order to be eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted using a standardised table; however, pooled analysis proved unfeasible. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS: Fifteen studies from four countries were included. Mental health worker integration was associated with mental health benefits to varied populations, including minority groups and those with comorbid chronic diseases. Furthermore, the interventions were correlated with high patient satisfaction and increases in specialist mental health referrals among minority populations. However, there was insufficient evidence to suggest clinical outcomes were significantly different from usual general practitioner care. CONCLUSIONS: While there appear to be some benefits associated with mental health worker integration in primary care practices, we found insufficient evidence to conclude that an onsite primary care mental health worker is significantly more clinically or cost effective when compared with usual general practitioner care. There should therefore be an increased emphasis on generating new evidence from clinical trials to better understand the benefits and effectiveness of mental health workers colocated within primary care practices.",slr_cem
9819735,Steijger D,Challenges and Limitations in Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022,"- BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness is a tool to maximize health benefits and to improve efficiency in healthcare. However, efficient outcomes are not always the most equitable ones. Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) offers a framework for incorporating equity concerns into cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to outline the challenges and limitations in applying DCEA in healthcare settings. METHODS: We searched Medline, Scopus, BASE, APA Psych, and JSTOR databases. We also included Google Scholar. We searched for English-language peer-reviewed academic publications, while books, editorials and commentary papers were excluded. Titles and abstract screening, full-text screening, reference list reviews, and data extraction were performed by the main researcher. Another researcher checked every paper for eligibility. Details, such as study population, disease area, intervention and comparators, costs and health effects, cost-effectiveness findings, equity analysis and effects, and modelling technique, were extracted. Thematic analysis was applied, focusing on challenges, obstacles, and gaps in DCEA. RESULTS: In total, 615 references were identified, of which 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most of these studies were published after 2017. DCEA studies were mainly conducted in Europe and Africa and used quality health-adjusted measurements. In the included studies, absolute inequality indices were used more frequently than relative inequality indices. Every stage of the DCEA presented challenges and/or limitations. CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the literature on the DCEA in healthcare as well as the challenges and limitations related to the different steps needed to conduct the analysis. In particular, we found problems with data availability, the relative unfamiliarity of this analysis among policymakers, and challenges in estimating differences among socioeconomic groups.",slr_cem
9998021,Belay YB,Cost Effectiveness of Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Treatments for Depression in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Literature Review,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Various treatment approaches are available for depression. Given the scarcity of healthcare resources, it is important to optimise treatment availability in an efficient manner. Economic evaluations can inform the optimal allocation of healthcare resources. However, there is currently no review synthesising what is known about the cost effectiveness of treatments for depression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: This review identified articles from six database searches: APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, EconLit, Embase and MEDLINE Complete. Trial- and model-based economic evaluations published between 1 January 2000 and 3 December 2022 were included. The quality of health economic studies (QHES) instrument was used to assess the quality of the included papers. RESULTS: This review comprised 22 articles, with most studies (N = 17) focusing exclusively on the adult population. Even though evidence regarding the cost effectiveness of antidepressants for treating various forms of depression was inconsistent; an atypical antipsychotic (aripiprazole) was frequently reported to be cost effective for treatment-resistant depression. Task shifting (aka task sharing) to lay health workers or non-specialist health care providers appeared to be a cost-effective approach for treating depression in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review found mixed evidence on the cost effectiveness of depression treatment choices among LMICs, with some indication that task sharing with lay health workers may be cost effective. Future research will be needed to fill the gaps around the cost effectiveness of depression treatments in younger people and beyond healthcare facilities.",slr_cem
8795065,Kongnakorn T,Modeling Challenges in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of First-Line Immuno-Oncology Therapies in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review,Pharmacoeconomics,2021,"- INTRODUCTION: The introduction of immuno-oncology (IO) therapies has changed the treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and technology appraisals (TAs) evaluating IO therapies have been recently published. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed economic models of first-line (1L) IO therapies for previously untreated advanced or metastatic NSCLC to identify methodological challenges associated with modeling cost effectiveness from published literature and TAs and to make recommendations for future CEAs in this disease area. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit (January 2009-January 2020), and select conferences (since 2016) for CEAs of 1L IO treatments in patients with recurrent or metastatic, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation-negative NSCLC, published in English. TAs from England, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Germany, and France were also examined. Two reviewers screened the results and extracted the data. The quality of the CEAs was described using the Drummond checklist. RESULTS: In total, 46 records reporting on 38 unique models met protocol-defined criteria and were included. Five models adjusted for treatment switching or crossover in base-case analyses, and the remainder considered treatment switching or crossover to represent clinical practice and made no adjustment. Seven models used external real-world data for survival modeling or extrapolation validation. Six models that assumed long-term treatment benefit stopped at 3 or 5 years after initiation. Seven models used the observed time-on-treatment distribution from the trial, and eight used progression-free survival for treatment duration. All models compared one or more IO monotherapies or combination therapies with chemotherapy. Only one study directly compared different IO agents but did not consider the concordance issue across programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing methods. Utilities were modeled by health state in 12 models, four applied a time-to-death approach, and ten explored both. None applied cure models. CONCLUSION: Variations in methodological challenges were seen across studies. Previous models took approaches that were followed in subsequent models, such as a 2-year stopping rule of IO duration or treatment-effect waning. Challenges such as heterogeneity in PD-L1 testing and survival extrapolation and validation using real-world data should be further considered for future models in advanced or metastatic NSCLC.",slr_cem
8324482,Conteh L,Costs and Cost-Effectiveness of Malaria Control Interventions: A Systematic Literature Review,Value Health,2021,"- OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the literature on the unit cost and cost-effectiveness of malaria control. METHODS: Ten databases and gray literature sources were searched to identify evidence relevant to the period 2005 to 2018. Studies with primary financial or economic cost data from malaria endemic countries that took a provider, provider and household, or societal perspective were included. RESULTS: We identified 103 costing studies. The majority of studies focused on individual rather than combined interventions, notably insecticide-treated bed nets and treatment, and commonly took a provider perspective. A third of all studies took place in 3 countries. The median provider economic cost of protecting 1 person per year ranged from $1.18 to $5.70 with vector control and from $0.53 to $5.97 with chemoprevention. The median provider economic cost per case diagnosed with rapid diagnostic tests was $6.06 and per case treated $9.31 or $89.93 depending on clinical severity. Other interventions did not share enough similarities to be summarized. Cost drivers were rarely reported. Cost-effectiveness of malaria control was reiterated, but care in methodological and reporting standards is required to enhance data transferability. CONCLUSIONS: Important information that can support resource allocation was reviewed. Given the variability in methods and reporting, global efforts to follow existing standards are required for the evidence to be most useful outside their study context, supplemented by guidance on options for transferring existing data across settings.",slr_cem
11697584,Willis M,Cost-effectiveness models of non–small cell lung cancer: A systematic literature review,J Manag Care Spec Pharm,2025,"- BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents a formidable global health challenge owing to significant morbidity, high mortality rates, and substantial economic burden. Recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies have transformed NSCLC treatment, but efficacy varies across patients. Tailoring treatment to patients can improve outcomes and potentially improve cost-effectiveness (ie, value for money) as well. For NSCLC, cost-effectiveness must often be estimated using economic modeling, and estimates are only as good as the models. Existing cost-effectiveness models are not necessarily suitable for evaluating personalized medicines. OBJECTIVE: To identify and assess cost-effectiveness models of NSCLC. METHODS: We searched for studies indexed in PubMed and Embase from 2012 to October 2023 that described cost-effectiveness models of NSCLC. Study details were extracted, summarized, and evaluated for adherence to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. RESULTS: We identified 237 unique models, 40% of which were published in 2022 or 2023. Despite cross-model heterogeneity, most models used the same 3 health states (progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death) combined with time-to-event equations that characterize risks. Thirty models included a diagnostic component, most of which considered guiding treatment selection using biomarkers. Adherence to the overall Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist was generally incomplete, and adherence to a subset of model-related questions even more so. CONCLUSIONS: The large number of models that were found, almost half of which were published since 2022, underscores the importance of cost-effectiveness analysis in NSCLC. Variable adherence to best practices suggests opportunities for improvement, however, and making high-quality, open-source models available to researchers may be valuable.",slr_cem

10478035,Wheatley MM,Cost-Effectiveness of HIV Retention and Re-engagement Interventions in High-Income Countries: A Systematic Literature Review,AIDS Behav,2022,"- Engagement in lifelong HIV care is critical for both patient and public health, yet there are limited resources to invest in improving HIV outcomes. We systematically reviewed evidence on the cost-effectiveness of retention and re-engagement interventions. We searched five databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2020. We assessed reporting and methods quality, extracted data on target populations, interventions, and cost-effectiveness, and evaluated overall strength of evidence. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, and eight had moderate-high quality. Cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from cost-saving to over $1,000,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Of the 73 cost-effectiveness ratios reported, 64% were < $100,000/QALY gained. Interventions were more likely to be cost-effective when targeted to high-risk groups, implemented in locations where baseline retention levels were low, and when used in combination with other high-impact HIV interventions (such as prevention). Overall, existing evidence is moderately strong that retention and/or re-engagement interventions can be cost-effective in high-income countries.",slr_cem
6386015,Di Tanna GL,Evaluating Cost-Effectiveness Models for Pharmacologic Interventions in Adults with Heart Failure: A Systematic Literature Review,Pharmacoeconomics,2018,"- BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a well-recognized public health concern and imposes high economic and societal costs. Decision analytic models exist for evaluating the economic ramifications associated with HF. Despite this, studies that appraise these modelling approaches for augmenting best-practice decisions remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of published economic models for the management of HF and describe their general and methodological features. METHODS: This SLR employed a combination of relevant search terms associated with HF, which were used in a number of databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, ScHARR Health Utilities Database and Cochrane Library Database. A number of model features (i.e. model structure, specification, outcomes assessed, scenario and sensitivity analysis, key model drivers) were extracted and subsequently summarized. RESULTS: Of 64 publications retained, a selection of modelling approaches were identified, including Markov (n = 28), trial-based analytic (n = 22), discrete-event simulation (n = 6), survival analytic (n = 7) and decision-tree modelling (n = 1) approaches. The bulk of publications employed either a cost-utility (n = 27) or cost-effectiveness (n = 36) analysis and evaluated more than one study outcome, which typically included overall costs (n = 59), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (n = 55), life-years gained (n = 48) and willingness-to-pay thresholds (n = 37). Most publications focused on patients with chronic HF (n = 40) and used New York Heart Association (NYHA) disease classifications to categorize patients and determine disease severity. Few (n = 19) publications documented the use of hospitalization states for modelling patient outcomes and associated costs. A quality assessment of the included publications revealed most articles demonstrated reasonable methodological value. CONCLUSIONS: We identified numerous decision analytic modelling approaches for evaluating the cost effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments in HF. A Markov cohort model approach was most commonly used, and most models relied on NYHA classes as a proxy of HF severity, disease progression and prognosis.",slr_cem
11782410,van Mossel S,A Systematic Literature Review of Modelling Approaches to Evaluate the Cost Effectiveness of PET/CT for Therapy Response Monitoring in Oncology,Pharmacoeconomics,2024,"- BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review addresses model-based cost-effectiveness studies for therapy response monitoring with positron emission tomography (PET) generally combined with low-dose computed tomography (CT) for various cancer types. Given the known heterogeneity in therapy response events, studies should consider patient-level modelling rather than cohort-based modelling because of its flexibility in handling these events and the time to events. This review aims to identify the modelling methods used and includes a systematic assessment of the assumptions made in the current literature. METHODS: This study was conducted and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement. Information sources included electronic bibliographic databases, reference lists of review articles and contact with experts in the fields of nuclear medicine, health technology assessment and health economics. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed scientific publications and published grey literature. Literature searches, screening and critical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers independently. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) were used to assess the methodological quality. The Bias in Economic Evaluation (ECOBIAS) checklist was used to determine the risk of bias in the included publications. RESULTS: The search results included 2959 publications. The number of publications included for data extraction and synthesis was ten, representing eight unique studies. These studies addressed patients with lymphoma, advanced head and neck cancers, brain tumours, non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer. All studies addressed response to chemotherapy. No study evaluated response to immunotherapy. Most studies positioned PET/CT as an add-on modality and one study positioned PET/CT as a replacement for conventional imaging (X-ray and contrast-enhanced CT). Three studies reported decision-tree structures, four studies reported cohort-level state-transition models and one study reported a partitioned survival model. No patient-level models were reported. The simulation horizons adopted ranged from 1 year to lifetime. Most studies reported a probabilistic analysis, whereas two studies reported a deterministic analysis only. Two studies conducted a value of information analysis. Multiple studies did not adequately discuss model-specific aspects of bias. Most importantly and regularly observed were a high risk of structural assumptions bias, limited simulation horizon bias and wrong model bias. CONCLUSIONS: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis for therapy response monitoring with PET/CT was based on cohorts of patients instead of individual patients in the current literature. Therefore, the heterogeneity in therapy response events was commonly not addressed appropriately. Further research should include more advanced and patient-level modelling approaches to accurately represent the complex context of clinical practice and, therefore, to be meaningful to support decision making. REGISTRATION: This review is registered in PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews funded by the National Institute for Health Research, with CRD42023402581.",slr_cem
10060315,Proudfoot C,Model parameters influencing the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure: evidence from a systematic literature review,Eur J Health Econ,2022,"- OBJECTIVES: To summarize cost-effectiveness (CE) evidence of sacubitril/valsartan for the treatment of heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The impact of different modeling approaches and parameters on the CE results is also described. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review using multiple databases: Embase(®); MEDLINE(®); MEDLINE(®)-In Process; NIHR CRD database including DARE, NHS EED, and HTA databases; and the Cost Effectiveness Analysis registry. We also reviewed HTA countries' websites to identify CE reports of sacubitril/valsartan, published up to 25-July-2021. Articles published in English as full-texts, conference-abstracts, or HTA reports were included. RESULTS: We included 44 CE models [39 from 37 publications (22 full-texts; 15 conference-abstracts) and 5 HTAs; Europe, n = 20; North and South Americas, n = 14; Asia and Australia, n = 10]. Most models adopted a Markov structure with constant transition probabilities of events (n = 27) or a mix of Markov and regression-based models (n = 16), with variations in structural assumptions and chosen parameters. Study authors concluded sacubitril/valsartan to be a cost-effective therapy in 37/41 models in chronic HFrEF patients and 2/3 models in hospitalized patients stabilized after an acute decompensation for HF. CE models showing sacubitril/valsartan not to be a cost-effective treatment generally modeled a shorter time horizon. Effect of sacubitril/valsartan on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, cost, duration of effect and time horizon was the main model drivers. CONCLUSIONS: Most evidence indicated sacubitril/valsartan is cost-effective in HFrEF. The use of a lifetime horizon is recommended in future models as HF is a chronic disease. Data on the CE of sacubitril/valsartan in the inpatient setting were limited and further research is warranted.",slr_cem
10020287,Li N,Cost Effectiveness Analyses of Interventions for Osteoporosis in Men: A Systematic Literature Review,Pharmacoeconomics,2023,"- BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is often considered to be a disease of women. Over the last few years, owing to the increasing clinical and economic burden, the awareness and imperative for identifying and managing osteoporosis in men have increased substantially. With the approval of agents to treat men with osteoporosis, more economic evaluations have been conducted to assess the potential economic benefits of these interventions. Despite this concern, there is no specific overview of cost-effectiveness analyses for the treatment of osteoporosis in men. OBJECTIVES: This study aims (1) to systematically review economic evaluations of interventions for osteoporosis in men; (2) to critically appraise the quality of included studies and the source of model input data; and (3) to investigate the comparability of results for studies including both men and women. METHODS: A literature search mainly using MEDLINE (via Ovid) and Embase databases was undertaken to identify original articles published between 1 January, 2000 and 30 June, 2022. Studies that assessed the cost effectiveness of interventions for osteoporosis in men were included. The Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases and the International Osteoporosis Foundation osteoporosis-specific guideline was used to assess the quality of design, conduct, and reporting of included studies. RESULTS: Of 2973 articles identified, 25 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, classified into economic evaluations of active drugs (n = 8) or nutritional supplements (n = 4), intervention thresholds (n = 5), screening strategies (n = 6), and post-fracture care programs (n = 2). Most studies were conducted in European countries (n = 15), followed by North America (n = 9). Bisphosphonates (namely alendronate) and nutritional supplements were shown to be generally cost effective compared with no treatment in men over 60 years of age with osteoporosis or prior fractures. Two other studies suggested that denosumab was cost effective in men aged 75 years and older with osteoporosis compared with bisphosphates and teriparatide. Intervention thresholds at which bisphosphonates were found to be cost effective varied among studies with a 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture that ranged from 8.9 to 34.2% for different age categories. A few studies suggested cost effectiveness of screening strategies and post-fracture care programs in men. Similar findings regarding the cost effectiveness of drugs and intervention thresholds in women and men were captured, with slightly greater incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men. The quality of the studies included had an average score of 18.8 out of 25 (range 13-23.5). Hip fracture incidence and mortality risk were mainly derived from studies in men, while fracture cost, treatment efficacy, and disutility were commonly derived from studies in women or studies combining both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-osteoporosis drugs and nutritional supplements are generally cost effective in men with osteoporosis. Screening strategies and post-fracture care programs also showed economic benefits for men. Cost-effectiveness and intervention thresholds were generally similar in studies conducted in both men and women, with slightly greater incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men.",slr_cem
